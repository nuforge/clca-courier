# Implementation Summary: User Settings Enhancements

## Overview

This implementation adds two key features to the CLCA Courier application's user settings system:

1. **Side Navigation Menu Collapse State Tracking**: The application now remembers whether the side navigation drawer is in mini/collapsed mode or fully expanded
2. **PDF Viewer Settings Integration**: PDF viewer settings are now properly connected and applied to the actual PDF viewer component

## 1. Side Navigation Menu Collapse State Tracking

### Changes Made:

#### A. Storage Service (`src/services/storage-service.ts`)

- Added `sideMenuCollapsed: boolean` property to the `UserSettings.display` interface
- Updated `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` to include `sideMenuCollapsed: false` as the default

#### B. User Settings Composable (`src/composables/useUserSettings.ts`)

- Added `sideMenuCollapsed` computed property to access the current state
- Added `setSideMenuCollapsed(collapsed: boolean)` method to update the state
- Exposed both new properties in the composable's return object

#### C. App Navigation Component (`src/components/AppNavigation.vue`)

- Updated to use the persisted setting instead of local `isMini` state
- Added watchers to sync between local UI state and persisted settings:
  - When persisted setting changes → update local UI state
  - When local UI state changes → persist to settings
- Initialize `isMini` ref from the user's saved preference

### How It Works:

1. When the application loads, the side navigation drawer's collapsed/expanded state is read from storage
2. Users can toggle between mini (collapsed) and full (expanded) modes using the chevron button
3. The state is automatically saved to localStorage/IndexedDB when changed
4. The next time they visit the site, their preferred navigation state is restored
5. The setting persists across all pages since it's handled in the global navigation component

## 2. PDF Viewer Settings Integration

### Changes Made:

#### A. PDF Viewer Component (`src/components/PdfViewer.vue`)

- Added import for `useUserSettings` composable and extracted `pdfSettings`
- Created `applyPdfSettings(instance: WebViewerInstance)` function that:
  - Applies user's default zoom level using `documentViewer.zoomTo()`
  - Sets page layout mode based on user preference (single/facing/cover)
- Called `applyPdfSettings()` during viewer initialization
- Added watcher for PDF settings changes to apply them in real-time
- Removed hardcoded `LayoutMode.FacingCover` setting to respect user preferences

### How It Works:

1. When a PDF viewer is initialized, it reads the user's saved PDF settings
2. The viewer applies the user's preferred:
   - **Default Zoom Level**: Sets initial zoom (0.5x to 3.0x)
   - **Page Layout**: Single page, facing pages, or facing with cover
   - **Thumbnail Size**: Small, medium, or large (for future UI enhancements)
3. If users change PDF settings while a viewer is open, the changes are applied immediately
4. The settings persist across browser sessions using the existing storage system

## Storage Architecture

Both features leverage the existing user settings storage system:

- **localStorage**: For immediate access and quick retrieval
- **IndexedDB**: For persistent backup and complex data structures
- **Automatic Fallback**: If one storage method fails, the system gracefully falls back to defaults

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Consistency**: Settings behavior is now consistent across the application
2. **Persistence**: User preferences are remembered across browser sessions
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are applied immediately without requiring page refresh
4. **Accessibility**: Clear labels and descriptions help users understand what each setting does

## Technical Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: All changes maintain TypeScript type safety
2. **Reactive**: Uses Vue's reactivity system for efficient updates
3. **Error Handling**: Inherits the robust error handling from the existing storage system
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead with efficient storage and retrieval

## Testing

The implementation has been:

- ✅ Type-checked with TypeScript (no compilation errors)
- ✅ Lint-checked (no ESLint errors)
- ✅ Tested with Quasar development server (builds successfully)
- ✅ Integrated with existing storage architecture

## Future Enhancements

This implementation provides a solid foundation for additional PDF viewer features:

- Annotation preferences
- Reading modes (continuous scrolling, page-by-page)
- Accessibility settings (high contrast, text size)
- Bookmarks and navigation preferences
