      "full_text": "'Vandal' Mystery Solved!\n\nWhen the snow finally melted in April, we began receiving calls from homeowners on the lake. There was a concern regarding what appeared to be vandalism to trees in that area. An inspection of the trees revealed at least one very busy beaver was at work over the winter cutting down trees for its lodge. Some of the trees were damaged as high as three feet from the ground and it was figured that the depth of the snow this winter allowed Mr. Beaver to reach new heights. From the appearance of the tree in this photo he must have some strong teeth and a good dentist.\n\nSAVE ThE DATE!\n\nAnnual Meeting Saturday Set For September 27, 2014\n\nThe Summer Issue of the Conashaugh Courier is our prelude to the Community's Annual Meeting.

Each of them are at their end of a well served six year term. Thank you also to former Board Member Paul Kelleher whose resignation was tendered in June for personal reasons. Director Reggie Iglesias assumed the role of Recreation Liaison upon Paul's departure and hit the ground running by also volunteering to chair the Annual Community Picnic.\n\nThere are many things we would like to do but we the Board do not want to put the burden of the expenses associated with them on our members in the form of higher annual dues.\n\nSafety and the enforcement of rules are important to us. W e are con¿dent that our current rules are reasonable while at the same time not adversely impacting or imposing upon the comfort or rights of those who live here.\n\nThere always seems that something new is coming down the pike in this business. This past January we along with other dam owners in the area were informed by the Department of Environmental Protection that beginning July 1st there would be an annual fee imposed for owning a dam. Failure to pay the fee came with a threat from the DEP of an order to drain our lake. Fortunately , with our dam being a non-hazard, category 2 dam, the fee was 800.00 which is nominal compared to some of the neighboring communities with multiple and/or high hazard dams. There are other interesting fees that the DEP would like to impose on our communities relating to dams. This is a concern to me and should be to you as well.  I along with other community leaders in the area wrote multiple letters to agencies ranging from local township and county supervisors to legislators to everyone in between regarding the impact these fees are causing to our communities and asking for intervention. As of this writing only one elected oɷcial, Senator Lisa Baker responded.\n\nThe payment of dues is of utmost importance for the continuous operation of any Community .  Thankfully a majority of our members are diligent with this responsibility . Non-payment of dues will only result in placing your account in collections and ¿nally judgment and a lien on your property . It is not something that we like to do but, if you ignore requests for payment and have no contact with the oɷce you leave us no choice. News released in February by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show volunteering in the nation is at a ten year low . V olunteers have been scarce here also. With parents working more and the demands of family life when you return home from work, sports and school, it is no wonder about statistics. Most of our committees have trickled to small down to zero participation. W e are thankful for whatever contributions are made, large or small.\n\nThe CLCA Board of Directors works cohesively and strives to hold down dues costs while at the same time maintaining the stated requirements set forth in ACT 180.  The Board throughout the month prepares for the monthly meetings to accomplish the tasks as approved by the Board. 2013/2014 brought with it a harsh winter, a tougher economy and increased pricing. The Finance Committee and Board worked very hard on the budget before you this September for a vote.  On that note I am asking that our members join me in approving the proposed budget for the 2014/2015 ¿scal year. If you have any questions about the proposed budget, please contact the CLCA Oɷce staɱ and they can direct you to my oɷce if needed..\n\nThank you, John Crerand, CLCA President\n\nSeptic Pumpi\n\nSepeirgenana\n\nSecurity Reports\n\nCOLONEL MANUEL SCHONHORN\n\nJAN 04-10, 2014: Car in snow bank; truck oɱ road; car oɱ road; broken gate.

If there are any out there who wish to volunteer to write up the security reports, report to the CLCA oɷce. But volunteering? Here? At CLCA? How silly!

You too can sign up by sending a request to clcaloop@ptd.net\n\nFrom The Office\n\nJEANNE CALABRESE\n\nThe last time I wrote we were up to our eyebrows in snow. As I write this now it is a balmy 90 degrees and summer is half way through. It was a busy winter and a very late arriving spring. The following are developments since the last report:\n\nProperties:\n\nThere are 563 Homes, 275 Lots and 28 contiguous lots. As of this writing, there are four foreclosed properties that have transferred back to the mortgage holders. By the time you are reading this, those homes will likely be sold. Foreclosure properties once transferred back to the mortgage companies are selling very quickly . There hasn't been any new tax sale activity since the last report. As of July 23, 2014 the W ayne Pike Realtor MLS site showed sixty properties for sale in the Community. In that mix are homes and undeveloped properties.\n\nRoads\n\nThere will be major road repair occurring on Conashaugh Trail early this fall. The road was originally scoped last year however, funds were not enough to complete the repair. A majority of this road will be repaved. One culvert pipe was removed in the vicinity of Sandy Pine T rail and at least four others will be removed. Additional information regarding paving will be posted on the LOOP and CLCA's Facebook page as I receive it.\n\nSecurity\n\nIn early July the patrol division of V ector Security was purchased by United American Security. The purchase did not aɱect our existing contract. Oɷcers working at this site for V ector maintained their positions.\n\nOɷcer Sara Gabell was promoted to site Sergeant. We are happy to have her here at our Community. She has been doing an excellent job.\n\nDue to a period of mischief and vandalism in the community, a security initiative was taken to monitor guests entering the Community. Volunteers worked on Friday and Saturday nights from 9 p.m. until midnight signing in guests. W e would like to continue these random security checks but are in need of additional volunteers. If you are able to help please call the oɷce. Thank you to John Crerand, Joe Lalor, Patti Havekost,\n\nRick Hordyszynski and Mike Stevenson who joined me volunteering in this project.\n\nIlluminated Sign\n\nThe housing for the sign at the mailbox parking lot was constructed by our Maintenance crew. A special thanks to Dave in Maintenance who personally milled a lot of the ¿nish pieces on the sign. It came out fantastic and there has been positive feedback.\n\nTrees\n\nAll members must obtain permits before removing any tree greater than 1' diameter. Inspections will be completed by Maintenance before a permit is issued. Please allow seven days for the inspection to be completed. Removal of trees without a permit is a violation subject to a ¿ne.\n\nTrash\n\nWe recently renewed our contract with W aste Management. Pricing for trash will remain the same with a slight (20.00 per month) increase for recycling charges.\n\nAs a reminder, the compactor is for household trash. This does not include building materials, wall to wall carpeting, large appliances, yard equipment or yard waste(leaves, branches, wood, rocks).\n\nWe are charged by the weight of the compactor bins. Can you imagine our trash costs if everyone threw their leaves in the compactor? Please rake leaves into your woods or have them removed by a landscaper.\n\nRecycling\n\nWaste Management began a two pick up per week schedule in July and will continue through the end of September. Unfortunately people occasionally still use the recycle bins to dump household trash or unwanted items. Do not do it. The area is under surveillance. People have been caught and ¿ned. And by placing your unwanted items with a \"FREE\" sign does not earn you a get out of jail card. Same goes for dumping at the compactor. If you have something to give away , put it on the LOOP or Facebook. And as a reminder:\n\nOur recycling program is single stream. Y ou do not have to separate your items. Glass, paper, aluminum, junk mail, newspapers, cardboard and most plastics are recyclable. Our hauler currently does not have a program to recycle plastic bags.\n\nDo not place plastic bags in the recycle bins. If you transport recyclables in bags, please deposit the empty bag in the marked receptacle located next to the bins. There is one exception for placing bags in the recycle bins and that applies to bags containing paper from shredding machines.\n\nSpring Dumpster Day\n\nA total of 4 thirty yard dumpsters were used to collect items. 3 dumpsters were used during the event held on May 17th, one of which was for collecting metal. A fourth dumpster was called in for additional items that could not ¿t in the 2 collection bins.\n\nA total of 14.83 tons of trash and fees totaling 2343.00 were collected.\n\nFor a comparison Fall 2013 Dumpster Day a total of 9.05 tons of trash was collected Total charges by County Waste was 1143.75.\n\nThere will be a fall dumpster day announced shortly . Please use these opportunities to clean up around your properties and dispose of larger items not appropriate for the compactor.\n\nRoad Clean Ups\n\nDon't worry, the maid will get it. That's what runs through my head when I pick up trash along the road when I walk the in my neighborhood. On that note I know that I am not alone in my eɱorts and want to take a moment to thank the following people who have also voluntarily cleaned up our roads; Bobby and Barbara Keller, Elizabeth Herman and family, Annette and Josh Musano. Thanks for caring and doing. Thank you also to anyone else who picks up in their neighborhood.\n\nDogs\n\nDogs at large continue to be a problem. The dog warden has been in the Community and hefty ¿nes administered. Unfortunately some are using the ball ¿eld to walk dogs and not picking up after them. Children play there and maintenance has to cut and weed whack the area. It is pretty unpleasant when you bring back a tractor with its wheels full of poop or hit one of those loads with a weed whacker. Have some consideration and do the right thing.\n\nUSDOT\n\nAs previously reported CLCA participates in random drug and alcohol testing. In February we received a report from the lab that performs lab testing of urine specimens s for the period between July and December 2013 during which time one preemployment and four random tests were performed. All ¿ve specimens reported negative results\n\nDam News\n\nBeginning July 1 of this year we were required to pay Annual Fees to the DEP for owning a dam.\n\nPennoni Associates conducted our annual dam inspection in early July and we are awaiting the results of that inspection.\n\nNew Well\n\nA new well was drilled for Conashaugh in July . The well will service the Rec Building, Pool and Maintenance yard. The well that previously serviced these areas is still intact as it is servicing two homes on the lake.\n\nLightning Strikes....Again\n\nOur member only entrance gate was struck twice by lightning over the 4th of July weekend both times taking out the card reader and the second time a dvr. W e are not the only victims of these strikes. Other communities have had similar problems. Fortunately there are now surge arrestors on that gate and while nothing is guaranteed to stop lightning damage, they have certainly helped to keep damages to a minimum.\n\nFacebook Page\n\nA number of other Communities shudder at the thought of having a Facebook Page. I am happy to report that ours has been up and running for several years with very little incident.\n\nJust a note about the page. It is there to share\n\ninformation about our Community. It is not there to tear down the Community with negative comments and/or personal opinions/ misconceptions about the operations, employees, projects or your neighbors. If you have a concern, comment or question pick up the phone or visit the oɷce.\n\nYou can also send a personal message via the Facebook page or an email to clcaloop@ptd.net.\n\nDues\n\nAll payment plans need to be paid in full by August 28th. Our new ¿scal year begins October 1st. Outstanding accounts will be sent to collections before the end of September. Please be advised that once an account is placed in collections, it will not be recalled. Current accounts with collections without successful recoveries will be reviewed and recalled for judgment at the Magisterial Court. Likewise once suit is ¿led it will not be withdrawn until all payments are satis¿ed.\n\nKnow Where Your Kids Are\n\nThere have been reports of break ins on some foreclosed or developing property homes. Please have some dialogue with your kids about the dangers and consequences of doing this. These homes are all owned by someone or a bank. Entering the homes is trespassing and a punishable crime. They are not club houses! Some owners have requested checks by security . If you wish to have a home check please contact the Security Oɷce at 570-686-1130.\n\nWWW .

During the past year I've worked closely with Oɷce personnel and members of the Finance Committee reviewing income and expenditures for the Community.\n\nThis year has been challenging. Record winter temperatures and snow had a large impact on our Maintenance lines along with continued foreclosures on properties and the overall increased costs of doing business. The good news is that with only a couple of months left in the ¿scal year and despite the hurdles, we are in good ¿nancial shape and don't anticipate any surprises to change that direction through the end of September.  Income has been suɷcient to fund both the Roads and General Reserve Accounts as planned for in the current year's budget.  Eɱorts by CLCA Oɷce staɱ and Sunrise Credit Services, our collection agency , have resulted in the recovery of old dues which has helped oɱset current uncollected funds. Old dues are monies that were due prior to, but not collected, before the current ¿scal year started.\n\nRecognizing old dues as income while still considering doubtful accounts was one of a couple of diɱerent approaches I used for preparing the proposed budget. I also compared last year's actual expenses and the expenses through eight months of the current ¿scal year and moved numbers within the budget lines to arrive at a proposed increase of 1.0% which translates $11.40 more than last year's\n\nbudget for the year or .95 cents per month. Our biggest single expense this year as in the past several years will be road work. As of this writing, a majority of Conashaugh T rail is slated to be repaved. It is one of three major roadways in the community and with that comes much wear and tear. This road came up as a recommended paving project last fall, however a collapsing section of Overbrook Run, another major roadway , and a number of smaller deteriorating roads were a priority . A number of folks have posed the question \"why do we repave\" roads that are already paved instead of paving the remaining unpaved roads. It is very important to keep our main roads maintained as best as possible and address any potential problems before they turn into greater problems. When funds allow additional new paving is considered. A majority if not all of the money used for these projects is from CLCA's Road Reserves.\n\nOne new expense being imposed on communities are fees by the Department of Environmental Protection. In anticipation of current and perpetually anticipated fees from this agency , a line has been added to the CLCA Reserve Schedule. Please see comments in the President's column regarding these  new charges and how they are impacting communities in our area.\n\nIn closing I ask that you join the Board and myself in approving the 2014/15 proposed budget. I am satis¿ed that it is a fair budget and one that will allow for us to operate for another year. If you have any questions regarding the budget, please contact the oɷce.\n\n2014/2015 Board Meetings\n\nAll meetings are held on the second Saturday of each month and begin at 10:30 a.m. in the Recreation Building.

Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nTrash Revisited\n\nBY ANNETTE MUSANO\n\nSeveral years ago I wrote an article for the Courier entitled \"T rash Begets T rash\".  In its contents I cited the duration of time it takes for various trash items to decompose/biodegrade.  At this time I have no intentions of repeating any of that information other than to remind my readers that aluminum foil, plastic bottles and Styrofoam cups are not biodegradable. It is quite obvious to me that many of the litter oɱenders out there either didn't read my article or just don't give a darn as this continues to be a signi¿cant problem along the various roads and common areas of Conashaugh.  I want to say that despite the fact that my son and I are growing somewhat weary, the constant new supply of trash will not deter us from our mission of trying to keep the roads litter free. It does, however, continue to boggle my mind that the littering somehow de¿les the laws of physics in this Community .  How else can you explain the mere fact that a person can walk along the road carrying a container full of liquid but once the product is consumed, the empty and obviously lighter weight receptacle can no longer be held on to and must but tossed on the road as if it is too heavy to carry .\n\nAs I see it, it all comes down to one simple word - RESPECT; respect for the earth, respect for the environment, respect for your Community, respect for your friends and neighbors, respect for yourself. In the immortal words of Forrest Gump, \"That's all I have to say about that.\"\n\nGot Stuff?\n\nDon't forget to send your CLCA (non-commercial) Classifieds to clcaloop@ptd.net .\n\nPlease include a description of the item for sale along with the asking price and your contact information.\n\nYou may also include a photo (jpg).  Call the office at 570-686-4000 if you have any questions.\n\nLOTS FOR SALE:\n\nLOT 1:\n\n102 Black Oak Ct. Lot 817, Sec 2.

Her physical therapy will also be undertaken there.  We have tried to acclimate our Tigercat to our NYC apartment, but he was miserable. He cried all day and night, lingering at the apt's  door. He needs and deserves a  loving home.  He is 14 years old, male, altered, and in good health.  He likes to be out at night, chasing chipmunks and mice. He roams close to home. He sleeps much of the day. He has been  content to rest in the sunroom, watching the animals feed on the deck outside the glass door. He needs a  home without other animals. He likes to doze next to a warm body on a couch.  He slept with me during the winter months. He has been a lovely pet. If someone cannot take him, maybe he can be fostered until we return. He comes with litter boxes, cat carrier, much food wet and dry.\n\nOur CLCA # :  570-686-1932.\n\nOur NYC # : 212-662-8660.

The following jobs during the gardening season can lead to a garden that is easier and more satisfying for the current as well as the next growing season.\n\nFeed the Soil.  Start with great soil and you'll wind up with great plants. Healthy plants get less diseases, attract less insect pests and require less water. Plus you won't have to remember to fertilizer every other week.  Start with a good analysis of your existing soil. You can have all the essential nutrients tested or just test the pH. Many nurseries provide this service as well as your local Cooperative Extension Service. If your soil is deficient in any minerals or nutrients, amend the soil according to recommendations. Slow release, organic fertilizers can help supplement deficient nutrients. Then keep adding organic matter, like compost, regularly.  Time Released Fertilizer and Water Polymers.  It's not practical to use compost or garden soil in containers and so some supplemental feeding is necessary to keep the plants going. Containers also dry out more quickly than garden bed soil, especially if the bed is mulched. So start your container gardening season by adding some slow release fertilizer pellets and some polymer crystals that grab, hold and slowly release water to the plant roots.  Add both at planting time. These products are widely available at garden centers.\n\nWater as Efficiently as You Can. Water is a precious resource and no gardener can afford to waste it. You can capture water in rain barrels and route to garden beds using perforated soaker hoses. Mulch. Many gardeners only view mulch as decoration.\n\nPi\n\nHeat System S\n\nMulch does make a garden look more attractive, but it also keeps the soil and plant roots cool, retains moisture so you can water less often, prevents weed seeds from seeing the light of day and sprouting and feeds the soil. Right there you've cut down on watering, weeding and fertilizing time.\n\nWeeds.  A completely weed-free garden is almost impossible to achieve. One approach is to limit their numbers with vigilance rather than try to eradicate them with extreme measures. By making weed prevention part of a weekly gardening routine, the task becomes less daunting over time.\n\nPesticides.  When it comes to pest control, start by identifying the enemy.  Once you know the pest you're fighting you can choose the best strategy. Soft-bodied insects like mites, aphids and immature mealybugs can be treated with a spray of 1 to 2 tablespoons of dish soap added to 1 gallon of water.\n\nChoose Lower Maintenance Perennials.  Make the backbone of your garden perennial Áowers that can take care of themselves.  Plants like Astilbes and Sedums, that look good all season and don't need deadheading, pinching or staking.  Here are even more low maintenance perennials: Black-Eyed Susans, Bleeding Hearts, Boxwood, Lavender, Peonies, Russian Sage and Spirea.\n\nWell, there you have it.  You can add plenty of beautiful landscape plants to your yard without a lot of work.\n\nHappy Gardening from the Ladybug.\n\nScouts Earn Swimming Pins\n\nCLCA Pool Manager Karli  Van Duzer working with Bear Cub Scouts Alexander Rodriguez,  Joseph Moreno and William O'T oole to earn their Swimming Elective Pin #19 and Swimming Sports Pin #3\n\nUnited American Security Phone Numbers\n\nGuard House at Front Entrance 570-686-1130\n\nGuard on Duty at CLCA 800-682-4722\n\nWhen paging please advise the operator that you are calling to have the officer on duty located and provide the location where the officer is needed (i.e., your home, compactor or other location).

Failure to pay the fee came with a threat from the DEP of an order to drain our lake. Fortunately , with our dam being a non-hazard, category 2 dam, the fee was 800.00 which is nominal compared to some of the neighboring communities with multiple and/or high hazard dams. There are other interesting fees that the DEP would like to impose on our communities relating to dams. This is a concern to me and should be to you as well.  I along with other community leaders in the area wrote multiple letters to agencies ranging from local township and county supervisors to legislators to everyone in between regarding the impact these fees are causing to our communities and asking for intervention.

I want to say that despite the fact that my son and I are growing somewhat weary, the constant new supply of trash will not deter us from our mission of trying to keep the roads litter free. It does, however, continue to boggle my mind that the littering somehow de¿les the laws of physics in this Community .

They may live next door, down the block or on the road that you speed down on your way to the mailbox, bus stop, shopping, work (pick one) or perhaps they live on the intersection where you run that stop sign because no one is there.\n\nUnfortunately, despite repeated reminders written in past articles, on Facebook postings and via the LOOP, there are some who just don't get it and continue to do their own thing and disregard the hazards they place upon their neighbors, themselves and their own children.\n\nSince the summer there has been an increase of members reporting others for traffic violations including but not limited to speeding, illegal passing, reckless driving, running stop signs and tailgating through the entrance gates. Some have even filed formal complaints resulting in violations with fines being issued. And yes, that can happen and it has. Of course just as with any other violation that may be issued, the recipient has the right to due process (a hearing).\n\nPlease slow down, please. Your neighbor has asked that you include in your resolutions for 2014 a promise to drive safely because the heartache you save may be your own.\n\nCommittees: Why Bother; All is Well!\n\nBy Bob Weed\n\nConashaugh Lakes is consistently ranked as one of the best private Communities in NEPA.  We all know this is the result of several factors, but perhaps the most important is the time, energy and devotion given by Community Members to the several Committees which help all Community Members communicate with the Board of Directors.  In turn, the Board acts on what is has been informed is necessary to the continued well-being of the Community.\n\nI speak for myself here as Liaison to the Rules and Regulations Committee, but I know what I say is equally true of the other Committees.\n\nThere has been no interest in attending the Rules and Regs meetings for months (held, you may note, every third Tuesday evening at 7 PM at the Rec Building).\n\nThe reason, I believe, is obvious: All is Well in every aspect of the maintaining of the Community's interest, concerns and welfare.  We have, apparently, achieved a level of excellence and efficiency at which all are quite comfortable; not only comfortable, but complacent; not only complacent, but convinced that All is Well. And when an entire Community is convinced, Utopia is upon us.\n\nNow there are those would argue the reverse; that all is so unwell that all the members have lost hope, faith and dedication to the Promise that was Conashaugh Lakes.  Couple those with individuals who prefer to suffer in silence and you have the very beginning of the crumbling of the Promise, of the slow decay of that Promise, the final withering of that Promise. How is it with you, Well or Unwell?\n\nVector Security Phone Numbers\n\nGuard House at Front Entrance Guard on Duty at CLCA\n\n570-686-1130 800-682-4722\n\nWhen paging please advise the operator that you are calling to have the officer on duty located and provide the location where the officer is needed (i.e., your home, compactor or other location).\n\nAlways call 911 in an emergency!\n\nNeed Help Solving The Quadratic Equation?\n\nBy Maddy DiGiovanni\n\nWhen he discovered that Apple's App Store lacked what he was looking for, Mr. Douglas Merritt, current resident and Physics teacher at Mountain Lakes HS in NJ, decided to take things into his own hands. He designed his own apps! It took a lot of research and experimentation, but he is of course a science teacher. As of now, Mr. Merritt has four apps available for purchase in the App Store. He has also created a website for his app designs, called The Fizix Group.\n\nIt all began a few years ago with linearization. To replace the hassle of laptops for the whole class, Mr. Merritt wanted a program that could automatically linearize the experimental data his students collected and be accessed from smartphones. He was fairly certain that someone would have invented one already. But he found nothing. 'I've been using Apple products since 1988,' Mr. Merritt says. So why not design his own Apple-facilitated program? He Áipped through the Xcode tutorials included with his Apple products and learned that it cost nearly one hundred dollars to join Apple's development team. 'I was thinking, that's kind of a lot of money to spend on something I'm not sure I'll really use. Would it be worth it?' he wondered.\n\nAccording to Mr. Merritt, two common 'practice' apps for beginners are calculators and quadratic function solvers. With this in mind, he chose the quadratic solver to learn programming before he would tackle the linearization app. He displays the un-updated version, explaining what features were missing from the original program.\n\n'This was what it used to be, but when I'd show it to people, they'd say, 'Wow, that's so cool, but what if it did this, too?' People were suggesting things left and right!' Mr. Merritt says. Now, the version in the App Store not only solves the quadratic equation, but displays the answer in radical form, lists pertinent values such as the discriminant, graphs the function, enables zoom and scroll, and displays the coordinates of points when they are tapped.  A very useful tool if you are enrolled in a class such as pre-Calc, Trigonometry, or Physics.\n\nAnother of his apps is a temperature converter. After perusing several Celsius/Fahrenheit converters already published in the App Store, Mr. Merritt noticed that none of them included the Kelvin scale. 'How lame is that?!' he exclaims, an incredulous look on his face. Naturally, he wrote a program including Kelvin. His engineering professor friend, however, was still unsatisfied. 'I showed it to him,' Mr. Merritt recalls, 'and he said, 'You forgot Rankines!' and I was thinking, 'What on earth is a Rankine…''\n\nAfter learning that the Rankine scale is a temperature measurement system commonly used by engineers, he edited his program to include that as well. Moreover, instead of purchasing a sound file for number-pad sounds, he simply recorded himself clicking a pen and programmed that in, too. If you ever use his Cool Converter, you will know that the sound effects are genuinely Mr. Merritt's.\n\nMr. Merritt also has two other apps on the app store.  One is an app specifically for his seniors. Called RUExempt it helps his seniors calculate if they are exempt from finals, one of the last senior privileges of the year.  The other is a social media app for a friend that is in the stamping business.  Titled Pooler, this app gives access to a very talented stamper named Catherine Pooler. It has her blog, where you can post messages, Facebook feed, and twitter feed.\n\nNow, Mr. Merritt is returning to the idea that started it all. He hopes to begin work on the linearization app soon. In the meantime, be sure to check out his four current publications in the App Store; The Blue Quadratic Solver, Cool Converter, RUExempt, and Pooler. Just go to the store and type in any of the titles.  Hope this helps with your homework!\n\nHeads Up! Road Ban Ahead!\n\nBy Jeanne Calabrese\n\nWith winter past the halfway mark, it is time to remind everyone that road bans are imminent.\n\nThis may be old news to some of our members. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them.  Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles.\n\nWe too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVW(gross vehicle weight) of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid February into March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/conashaughlakes.\n\nPlease keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, nonemergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance  vehicles are exempt from road bans.  Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nGot Stuff?\n\nDon't forget to send your CLCA (non-commercial) Classifieds to clcaloop@ptd.net .\n\nPlease include a description of the item for sale along with the asking price and your contact information.\n\nYou may also include a photo (jpg). Call the office at 570-686-4000 if you have any questions.\n\n2.5 AC CORNER LOT\n\nWe are selling our 2.5 acre corner lot on the corner of Witherspoon court and Whipple way, lot #4301.  It is such a nice big corner lot by the ball ½eld and there isn't many houses around. It has an active 4 bedroom septic permit which expires on July 2nd 2016!

As I am writing this, the temperature for the second round so far this season is in the negative digits. It's probably the coldest it's been for many of us in a while. A big thank you to our Maintenance Employees who have worked hard to keep up with snow plowing, working very late nights, early mornings and holidays.\n\nPROPERTIES\n\nThere are currently 562 Homes, 28 Contiguous lots, 283 Undeveloped Lots and 38 CLCA owned Lots in the Community.  Twenty six resale packets have been issued since July 2013. Sales of properties have included undeveloped land, foreclosures and owner sales.\n\nTAx SALES\n\nIn November the Community purchased Lots 1601, 4006, 2419, 1623,6009, 5218 and 5723 from the Pike Tax Respository. These lots were offered to Conashaugh for  purchase to be used for Clean and Green Areas. The price charged for each lot was $25.00.  The lots cannot be sold or developed under the agreement of the purchase.\n\nTax Sales offer good deals on properties; however, anyone considering purchasing a property needs to do their home work. It is very important to check Deeds for right of first refusal clauses or other restrictions that remain with the property until removed legally. Depending on the type of sale you will also need to check to see if liens, unpaid dues or mortgages are applicable.\n\nROADS\n\nWayco arrived on October 10 and began needed maintenance and repair work on Pequot, Sandy Pine, Lenape and Overbrook. One of the areas that needed to be addressed was a section of Overbrook Run between the intersections of Cree Trail and Flatbrook where water draining from wetlands located on the green area between Gwinnett, Oneida, Braxton and Overbrook was causing the road to collapse in the center. A drain pipe was installed to help better distribute\n\nGet into the LOOP\n\nWe have over 700 email addresses on our mailing list for folks to receive announcements of events at CLCA. You too can sign up by sending a request to clcaloop@ptd.net water passing under the roadway and then the pavement was repaired.  Lower Overbrook between Seneca and Conashaugh were showing severe signs of deterioration and were top coated with asphalt. Unfortunately, this year funds did not allow for the paving of any unpaved roads. Repairs to Lenape were to finish repairs that were made in 2012.\n\nI L L U MINATED SIGN\n\nFollowing an approval by the Board in September, a new illuminated sign and wind cover were purchased for the mailbox/recycling area. The sign has been temporarily and partially erected so that electrical conduits could be routed to where the permanent sign will stand. This was done in late fall before frost and freeze set in.  Maintenance will be building a housing for the sign this spring and landscaping will also be done. The sign will be illuminated and used to post events and alerts for the community.\n\nPOOL\n\nAs previously reported the pool received a new liner, tile work and skimmers before the start of the 2013 season. A new winter pool cover was purchased and installed in October. We are currently accepting applications for lifeguards at the office. Lifeguards must be certified.\n\nTRAINING\n\nMaintenance Foreman Dave Altemier attended a two day course in November that covered unpaved roads. The class was a Dirt Road Maintenance training program and it took place at the Lord's Valley Training/Com Center. While Dave is highly experienced when it comes to this topic, feedback from him regarding the class was that the class was informative and provided information and reassurance that unpaved roads here are being maintained correctly.\n\nDUES\n\n2013-14 Dues notices were mailed in early October. The deadline for submitting a plan and payment was November 15th. Thank you to our members who have made dues a priority.  If you are reading this and have not received your dues notice, please contact the office as soon as possible. In November accounts for 45 properties which included multiply owned properties  by single owners, unpaid judgments and members who have been out of contact with the office regarding delinquent dues,  were referred to Sunrise Credit for collections.  After ninety days from assignment, unsuccessful collection files will be referred to the District Magistrate for judgments. This is an unfortunate step to take, however one that must be taken.\n\nOn several occasions members have stated that they wish that they could have worked something out or, we should have called them. Reminders are mailed and/or emailed to members who are delinquent, several times each year. When members do not respond to the reminders and/or make no attempt to maintain a payment plan, it leaves us no option. To avoid collections, please keep in contact with the office and make sure that you are consistent with making payments. As a reminder files referred to collections and/or the Magistrate will not be recalled until dues and expenses are settled.\n\nRECYCLING\n\nEffective November 12, 2013 the recycling pick up day was changed from Friday to Tuesday. As a reminder, please crush all boxes and do not put Styrofoam or plastic bags* in the recycle bins. (*only plastic bags containing shreds may be placed in bins).  Also as of September 1, 2013 recycling of certain materials is mandatory in Dingman Township and the burning of trash is prohibited. On a similar note we were notified by the Township that burning of yard waste was also prohibited. An inquiry and information supplied by one of our residents on this subject led to an inquiry to Dingman Township. It was learned that the law is under review by the Township and that the ban to burn yard waste is voluntary until further notice. All procedures set forth in Town Ordinances and Community rules must be followed when burning. If you have any questions, please contact the office.\n\nOFFICE REPAIRS\n\nMold and damaged insulation were found in the crawl space of the office. Bids were obtained and Cassagrande Contracting removed and replaced insulation and cleaned up the mold condition and an outlet and fan for circulation was installed. Work was completed in November.\n\nSALT SHED\n\nThis building is used to store winter road materials. The original roof was deteriorating and the T-111 siding was showing signs of wear. A new roof was installed over the summer and vinyl siding was completed in the fall to extend the life of the building.\n\nANNUAL FINANCIAL AUDIT\n\nEach year our books are independently audited. Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska are currently conducting an audit of Conashaugh's records for 2012-2013. Results of the audit are due in February.\n\nREC EVENTS\n\nOur new Recreation Chairperson Jessica Olcott has worked very hard to provide recreational events for adults and children. Thank you Jessica for your hard work and volunteerism.\n\nThank you to all who volunteer their time and talents to our Community .\n\nPennDOT Donates Supplies for Clean Up Day\n\nBy Jeanne Calabrese\n\nThanks to CLCA member Cheryl Hussey who facilitated a donation of supplies from PennDOT for CLCA's Clean Up Day last spring.  Items donated included safety vests, work gloves and trash bags.\n\nClean up day was held in conjunction with CLCA Dumpster Day. A total of 15 volunteers worked cleaning up roads and waterways, recycling metals and electronics as well as hauling large amounts of trash into dumpsters.  Dumpster Day workers included Neil Johnson, Larry Farnum, Fred Kline, Joe Kistle and Mike Stevenson. The road clean up crew included Annette and Josh Musano, Kate Green, Gary Dolgoff, Scott and Elizabeth Bailey and Jeanne Calabrese.\n\nThe spring dumpster day yielded a total of 16 tons of trash. A second dumpster day was held in September. That collection yielded 9.05 tons of trash. Volunteers for the fall Dumpster Day included Neil Johnson, Bob Weed, David Weed, Mike Stevenson, Larry Farnum, Fred Kline and Joe Kistle.\n\nThank you to all the volunteers who participated. If anyone would like to organize a road clean up or help with Dumpster Day this spring, please contact the office.\n\nNot Just for the Kitchen\n\nWe received word from one of our residents regarding the following:\n\n'I just wanted to pass on something we have discovered many times while out walking around the community (but did not know what they were until yesterday).  We have found these small 'whip-it' canisters laying on the ground in the beach parking area as well as alongside the road.  (see attachment) When used to make whipped cream as intended, they are harmless.  However, many people are using them as inhalants these days to get high-the canisters contain nitrous oxide.  They can be purchased at Walmart legally as part of kits to make whipped cream which makes them easily accessible.  I didn't know what these canisters were until I had to complete some drug abuse awareness training for my job.  It would be worth passing this along to security. They may already be well aware of these items-in the case they are not, it would be good for them to know of this problem.'\n\nThe information was shared with security along with a picture of the packaging for the items of concern.\n\nWe are just sharing this info for our parents and guardians so that they may be aware as well.\n\nResidents Mourn Passing of Sgt. Mattner\n\nContinued from page 1...\n\nofficer. He also was a United States Marine. After moving to this area with his family he joined Vector Security. Tom not only served Conashaugh but was also a member of  the Dingman Township Volunteer Fire Department where he worked their Fire Police Team. He loved his family dearly and liked working in our Community.\n\nTom is survived by his wife Michele, his children Danielle, Sabrina and TJ and grandsons Deklan and Mason.  He is missed tremendously.\n\nMany of our residents expressed their appreciation for Tom as well as their sadness following his passing.\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK!\n\nwww.facebook.com/ conashaughlakes\n\nFriendly Reminders\n\nPlease follow all traf½c ¾ow signs for the mailbox and school bus parking lot.

This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow.  If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicle at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road.\n\nShoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and is a Safety Violation subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible for alerting them of this regulation.\n\nKeep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe.\n\nAerobics!\n\nEVERY TUESDAY & THURSDAY 6:00-7:00 PM\n\nIn the Rec.

Those are the words that are heard often as January turns to February and thoughts of warm spring weather seem silly at best.  As winter is wrapping up and the excitement of the coming spring is upon us we can prepare for the months to come by doing some things in the garden.\n\nQuick, before the buds appear, now is the perfect time to prune your deciduous trees and late-blooming shrubs while they are still dormant. Always prune with a purpose:  to get rid of sprouts growing at or near the base of the tree trunk, to remove dead, broken or crossed branches, to make plants more shapely opening up the center of the plant for good air circulation and sun exposure.  Be careful with Áowering shrubs that formed their buds in the late fall; pruning will result in losing Áowers this spring, so prune wisely\n\nAs temperatures begin to warm, and plants emerge from dormancy, slowly remove protective mulches.  Don't remove too early. A warm day may make you think spring is almost here but there may be more cold weather to come, and hard freezes are still possible.\n\nA good guide for plant performance under local, low temperature conditions is the plant hardiness zone map. Our area is classified as zone 5b.  That means a plant described as 'hardy to zone 5b' can withstand a minimum temperature of -15°F.  Keep in mind that climatic factors such as wind and sun exposure, snow cover and proximity to water combine to produce different 'microclimates' which can inÁuence plant adaptability and timing of certain garden chores.\n\nEndless hours of enjoyment await you, but you have to pay your dues in the late winter and early spring.  If you meet the plants basic requirements, they will be happy and your yard will be amazingly beautiful. Happy Gardening from the Ladybug.\n\nHALLOWEEN FUN!\n\nAdvertise!

Our next Market is Memorial Day Weekend 2015 (Saturday and Sunday)\n\nGot Mail? Or Maybe You Didn't...\n\nBY JEANNE CALABRESE\n\nThere has been an ongoing issue of mail here being delivered to the wrong boxes. W e share our members' concerns regarding this and while missing mail is a U.S.P .S. matter, we have been trying our best to reconnect members with their lost items. W e ask that our members help with this effort by doing the following:\n\nIt is very important that if you have any concerns regarding the delivery of your mail or packages that you express this concern with the Milford Post Master, Juan Calle. His phone number is 570-296-7411.\n\nPlease pick up your mail regularly and go through it as soon as possible. If you get something that is not yours, please do not hold onto it. There are outgoing mailboxes in each mailbox cluster where incorrectly delivered mail can be placed. Please do not put it in the blue US Mail box. It will go on a journey somewhere in Lehigh V alley only to come back this way again.\n\nPlease do not write, 'no such person/return to sender' on items that are correctly addressed but placed in the wrong recipient's box. The address and person probably do exist, however, the mail was delivered to the wrong mailbox.\n\nPlease do not leave incorrectly delivered mail on top of the mailboxes. It can blow away or become damaged from the elements or taken.\n\nIf you receive a package that is not yours, please do not just leave it in the parcel box. Parcel boxes are unsecured once opened. During business hours, please bring parcels to the oɷce. W e understand that it's the Post Oɷce's job to ensure delivery and not the people living here, but it is the neighborly\n\nthing to do. Put yourself in the place of the person waiting for that package.\n\nIf it's not yours, please don't keep it. That's stealing.\n\nA new carrier was assigned to our community on January 10, 2015. Her name is Rafalina (sp). Please give her a chance. Hopefully things will improve.\n\nHeads Up! Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read\n\nBY JEANNE CALABRESE\n\nWinter is past the halfway mark and it is time to remind everyone that road bans are imminent.\n\nThis may be old news to some of our members. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between speci¿c months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. W e too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact.\n\nUnlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. W e are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVW(gross vehicle weight) of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans can be expected in March and April this year. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/conashaughlakes. Please feel free to call the oɷce if you do not have access to the internet.\n\nPlease keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, nonemergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they 'didn't know'. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency , fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the oɷce. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nImportant Reminders Regarding Snow\n\nPlease note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. W e are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very diɷcult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway , please keep vehicles at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road.\n\nShoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to ¿nes. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible to for alerting them of this regulation.\n\nKeep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe.\n\nUnited American Security Phone Numbers\n\nGuard House at Front\n\nEntrance 570-686-1130\n\nGuard on Duty at CLCA 800-682-4722\n\nWhen paging please advise the operator that you are calling to have the officer on duty located and provide the location where the officer is needed (i.e., your home, compactor or other location). Always call 911 in an emergency!\n\nJAGGER ASPHALT PAVING\n\nng\n\neas\n\nCLC ASSOCIATION\n\nFrom The Office\n\nJEANNE CALABRESE\n\nHal Borland wrote \"No Winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn\". Good words to live by if you are not a fan of Jack Frost. W e had an early start with a heavy snowfall on Thanksgiving Eve, Unfortunately in exchange for snow in January we have had quite a bit of ice which proved treacherous for driving and walking. Ice was also taxing on our maintenance staff and snow and ice material supplies. Thankfully there has been a relief in gas prices, with costs the lowest in more than ¿ve years. This is especially helpful since taxes on fuel increased. With spring almost on the horizon, please keep a watchful eye for road bans in our Community. There is a separate article on this subject on page 3.\n\nThe following are some events, happenings and projects that have taken place since our Annual Courier.\n\nAugust:\n\nMaintenance removed pavement areas at the main and member entrance areas and installed new loops for the gates. W ayco paved both areas. Project cost $52,227.39. this project was paid from the Capital Improvement Fund.\n\nInstallation of a new well to service the Maintenance and Pool yards was completed. The new well is 500 feet deep and was installed by Knight Drilling. CLCA Maintenance dug trenches for new wiring and lines for the well, reducing costs. Project cost: $9707.12. Payment for this project was made from the Capital Improvement Fund.\n\nWWW . MICHAELE\n\nWe were informed that the appeal ¿led by CLCA and Sunrise Lakes Community Associations with regard to Airline Fuel/Jo-Jo Oil's planned transfer station on Route 739 was rejected in the Supreme Court. There haven't been any further developments reported regarding plans for the property. It was learned however, that Airline Fuel is no longer in the propane business and that Keystone Fuel purchased that part of the company.\n\nMaintenance completed removal of dead trees from woods surrounding mailbox area.\n\nThank you to Reggie Iglesias, the Recreation Committee and all of the volunteers who worked on the Annual Picnic. Musical entertainment for the picnic was provided and donated by Conashaugh's very own Paul Renstrom and Denise Hunter's band.\n\nMembers in our Community were very generous donating food, bedding, coats and other needs for the Pike County Humane Society during a drive held in the CLCA Oɷce.\n\nTwelve members were contacted regarding delinquent 2013/2014 dues and informed that referral to Sunrise Credit was imminent. Seven of the twelve members produced payment and the remaining ¿ve accounts were sent to collections. Thank you to our members who make paying dues a priority . Dues are essential to the health and ongoing operations in our Community.\n\nSeptember:\n\nNerves were on edge in our area this month and throughout October while the Pennsylvania State Police and Law Enforcement Agencies from across\n\nRepresenting the wrongfully accused.\n\nthe country searched for Eric Frein. For those not familiar with the events surrounding this search, Mr. Frein is suspected of ambushing two State Police Oɷcers outside their barracks in Blooming Grove on the evening of September 12. He was located and apprehended on October 30th. Thank you to our members who generously donated supplies to help sustain those agencies through a collection by Laura Elaro's Girl Scout T roop 52-735 at Conashaugh and other collection sites in Pike County .\n\nThe Annual Meeting was held at the St.Vincent dePaul Parish Hall on September 27th where the 2014/2015 proposed budget passed by a majority vote of 83 yes to 36 nay . 4 Members abstained. Candidates Reggie Iglesias and Josef Lalor were elected to the CLCA Board of Directors.\n\nA speed bump was purchased to replace one stolen from Oneida W ay in August. Y es, that would be stolen, skillfully removed along with the nine bolts holding it to the road and the warning signage. The new speed bump will be installed for spring/summer 2015.\n\nMaintenance installed a pole and lighting in the bus lot. Cost for materials totaled $652.06. Maintenance did all labor. A previous estimate to install lighting was obtained from an electrical contractor for $2,000 plus with our maintenance employees digging trenches and installing footings.\n\nPike County Tax Claim held an Upset Sale on September 24th. A total of 27 properties in our Community were listed for the sale that included 6 developed(houses) properties, 1 partially developed(under construction) property and 20 undeveloped lots. The six developed and one partially developed lots along with ¿ve undeveloped properties were removed prior to the sale(taxes paid). There were no bids made on the remaining 15 undeveloped properties. For information regarding tax sales in Pike County visit http://www.pikepa.org/tax.html.\n\nA major paving project was completed on Conashaugh Trail by W ayco Paving. Prior to that project our maintenance department removed ¿ve aging culvert pipes and replaced pipes where needed. The project area stretched from the intersection of Overbrook Run to Bartlett Drive. Project cost $198,834.10.  Payment for this project was made from the Road Reserve Fund.\n\nOctober:\n\nThe deteriorating Maintenance yard fence was replaced by American Fence. The original wooden fence had been in place for numerous years. Maintenance dismantled the old fence and salvaged wood where possible. Additional sets of gates were installed with the new fencing to allow for removal of snow within the maintenance yard and safer entry and exit for maintenance vehicles. The total cost for the project was $10,700.00. Payment for this project was made from the Capital Improvement Fund.\n\nTreesmiths Company (hired by Met-Ed) completed clearing of branches and dead trees away from power lines in the Community.\n\nFall Dumpster Day was held October 4th. Four, thirty yard containers were used for the collection. 9.42 tons of trash were collected. The total bill for dumpster day was $1381.50 and the total amount of fees collected was $1225.00. Thank you to our Maintenance Crew who along with volunteers Neil Johnson, Joe Kistle, Fred Kline and Josef Lalor, spent a very soggy day unloading vehicles in the maintenance yard.\n\nThe recycle bins were relocated within in the mailbox area to a more discreet location. A number of comments were received regarding the appearance of the bins where they were previously located. The new location along with fencing blinds the view of the bins from vehicles driving into the community. The fence was constructed by Maintenance from wood salvaged during the demo of the old maintenance yard fence.\n\nTrunk or T reat was held by Seneca Lake. Thank you Recreation Committee Chairperson Jessica Olcott for organizing this event and to all of the participants who participated including members of the Dingman Township Fire Department.\n\nNovember\n\nTwo homes in the Community were damaged by ¿re. (See article page 11).\n\nNot something we like to do but, continued inaction to address unpaid dues resulted in three residents losing mailbox privileges. The members made no attempt to contact us regarding repeated requests to do so and left no alternative. On that note, unless you have nothing else better to do with $500.00, lending your address/mailbox to anyone who has lost this amenity is not recommended. It is a violation.\n\nA second hearing took place in Magistrate Cooper's court in the matter of CLCA vs. Person Who Thought it Was a Good Idea to Deliberately Break Member Gate. The lovely defendant failed to show and a decision including ¿nes and restitution was rendered.\n\nOn a more palatable subject, member Ginger Jones held a two night class where she shared her expertise and soup recipes. Attendees reported enjoying the event and getting to meet others in the Community. Thanks Ginger!\n\nDecember\n\nThank you to Jessica Olcott and Barbara Hamilton for doing a beautiful job with the CLCA Family Christmas Party. There were a number of very happy faces at the event held at the St. Vincent dePaul Parish Hall. Activities included craft stations and a visit by the ever delightful Santa Claus. Member Ginger Jones did a lovely job chairing an Adult Christmas Party at the Rec Building. Ginger and husband Jim prepared wonderful appetizers and refreshments. For something different, ornaments were exchanged between attendees.\n\nCongratulations to the winners of this year's Holiday Home Decorating Contest. The following homes took the top three prize: 195 Oneida, 188 Conashaugh Trail and 104 Hart Court.\n\nOn the Horizon\n\nDo you need to rid your home or property of some items? As you wait and search for the ¿rst signs of spring, start your inventory of items to either dispose of at Dumpster Day(watch for date) or sell at the CLCA Annual Memorial Weekend(Sat & Sun) Flea Market. Members are also free to post items for sale or to give away on Conashaugh's Facebook Page and the LOOP .\n\nNew CLCA Bulletin Board on the Way\n\nThe CLCA Bulletin Board previously at the Compactor was removed during the Maintenance Yard fence project. The rolling style and location of the new gate prevented safe reinstallation of the old board i n its original location. A new bulletin Board will be mounted in the Mailbox area. Dave designed the board to compliment the Pizza Board housing. He along with the Maintenance Crew are constructing it as a winter/indoor project. The location for the new board is as traveled/used as the compactor area. Benefits include l ess lingering in the trash area which can become congested just from trash traffic during peak periods. Postings on the new board will be required to be dated to allow removal after 30 days.\n\nConashaugh Kids First Day Back To School\n\nPA038927\n\nShop Local\n\nSUPPORT THE LOCAL BUSINESSES FEATURED IN THE CONASHAUGH COURIER\n\nSTORAGE KING\n\nRt. 739 Lords Valley Next to Century 21\n\nSELF STORAGE\n\nBOAT RV TRAILERS TOO TRUCK RENTALS\n\nFREE TRUCK USE\n\nWITH MOVE-INS*\n\n2014 Adult Christmas Party\n\n2014 Family Christmas Party\n\nCONASHAUGH\n\nLETTERS\n\nThanks for doing a good job clearning the snow\n\nWe are lucky to have a great crew who do a good job with our roads.\n\nWet compacting snow is very hard to clear and even on holidays they are out there doing the best they can.

Smoke was observed pouring through the roof. The second ¿re occurred in a neighboring home at 151 Seneca on November 11th. The report of that ¿re came to Maintenance Foreman Dave Altemier who responded to the scene immediately. The approximate time of discovery was 8:00 a.m. Although Seneca is typically busy with traɷc at that time of day , November 11 was a school holiday . Things got tense during the second ¿re when embers and arching power lines fell to the ground igniting leaves. Maintenance personnel using hand held extinguishers kept the ground ¿res from spreading towards properties on Cayuga T rail. While ¿re¿ghters fought the building Àames. Both ¿res were investigated by the PSP Fire Marshall.\n\nLOT FOR SALE\n\nLot 1402, Section 5 - Seneca Drive. Lake view lot. 1.13 acres. $28,999.

Thank you\n\nWINTER GARDENING\n\nThe winter garden generally needs less care, as nature seems to go to 'sleep' with the arrival of the season. Cold days. Dark nights. It's easy to go into hibernation. This is a good time to start thinking, planning and designing your dream garden. Cuddle up in your favorite chair next to the ¿replace and peruse those garden catalogs or go online early for the best selections.\n\nThere are quite a few things to look after in order to preserve your garden's health and prepare it for the spring. Here are a few things from indoor projects to planning for the spring season you can do to ward off cabin fever:\n\nStart indoor seeds of annuals that have slow growth (lobelia, petunia, vinca, snapdragon, verbena and pansies). Y ou can purchase these later from your local gardening center, but it is much cheaper to grow yourself and you can try unusual varieties that may not be available locally .\n\nPrune away storm-damage branches promptly to prevent tearing of the bark and further damage to trees and shrubs. Prune narrow leafed evergreens to improve shape and clean out winter damaged branches such as yews, junipers and arborvitae. While you're out there, force a winter bouquet from cut branches of forsythia, pussy willow, wisteria or lilac. Bruise the cut ends and set them in water. Spray the branches frequently , keep in a cool place until they bloom and then move to a warmer area for display .\n\nRe-invigorate your houseplants by removing a 1/2 inch of soil and top-dressing with fresh potting soil. Spider mites are apt to thrive in warm, dry houses. Frequent misting under the leaves will discourage them. Keep in mind that houseplants will be sensitive to overfeeding at this time of the year. Provide lots of sunlight, and frequent bathing for plants that seem a little worse for the winter. Don't forget to rotate houseplants so they get even sun and growth. Begin to prune these plants regularly in March by pinching back new growth.\n\nResist the temptation to uncover spring-Àowering plants. Mulch may be loosened, but the shoots will still bene¿t from protection against cold, drying winds. Remove mulch in stages once night time temperatures rise into the 30s. Pull off some of the mulch, leaving some material behind. A week or so later, pull back the rest, but don't remove it from the area. Leaving it close by the plants will allow you to easily cover them if a late cold snap hits. Mulch removal should be done on a cloudy day. This will allow any early growth to become acclimated to brighter conditions gradually - if you remove the mulch on a clear day, the plants could be scalded by the sudden bright sun light.\n\nWith spring just around the corner, the ¿ckle March weather makes it impossible to set exact dates and schedules for gardening, so proceed with caution!\n\nHappy gardening from the Ladybug\n\nMaintenance\n\nPhilly Viscardo\n\nPam Riddlehoover\n\nPAGE 16\n\nCONASHAUGH\n\nCOURIER\n\n•  WINTER\n\n2015\n\n",

It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 2015/2016 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting always takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 26th. This year it will be held at the St. Vincent's Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m.  Despite folk lore and tales of insanity past, the meetings of the last several years have gone smoothly albeit are lightly attended. Refreshments will be served. Approximately one month before the meeting all members are mailed a ballot. Owners are permitted one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party . For example if two people together own ¿ve properties, they are only eligible for one vote.  If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact the CLCA oɷce.\n\nVotes can be cast by mail or in person. If you are returning your ballot by mail, it is important that you use the provided envelope addressed to our Accountants, Beck, Gogolski and Poska. Please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Oɷce. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy . This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote.\n\nIf you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that person's position and visa-versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed by us as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Oɷce.\n\n2015 President's Report\n\nBY FRED KLINE\n\nTo all CLCA members:\n\nAmong the many lessons I've learned in more than ¿fty some years in a variety of endeavors is the value of a trusted advocate.\n\nAs President of the CLCA board of Directors, I can assure you that the members of the Board are strong advocates for the interests of our Community Members. W e work hard to represent your interest by working with Oɷce staɱ to see that everything done is for the bene¿t of all members, both young and old. The Board of Directors and the staɱ in the Oɷce are always concerned that all we do is for your bene¿t and no one else's.\n\nThis year we have again accomplished road paving with one dirt road paved and several others updated to maintain their condition as they age. W e intend to pave another dirt road next year. Maintaining the roads that are already paved are a priority . This year we were able to pave more length of road using a tar and chip application.  This method is less expensive than traditional paving and allows for the life of a road to be extended. It won't allow the time between re-paving to be as long as the previous methods. It should help in allowing us to pave all or a portion of a dirt road each year.\n\nPaving all or a portion of a dirt road is my goal. Many ask how it is decided which dirt road will be paved. Several factors go into deciding this such as the number of developed properties on a road, length of the road, traɷc use for the road, cost to maintain the unpaved road and last but not least money available to do the paving.\n\nAlso this year we were able to replace the Grader that was purchased in 1970 at a cost of $42,000. At a 3% inÀation rate over the years the cost to replace it would have been $98,700.00.  W e were able to purchase a newer, used grader for $ 45,825 while receiving $22,000 for our trade in.\n\nLate this year the Ford F350 reached the end of its life and we have replaced it with a used Chevrolet Silverado. The F350 was purchased in 2006 at a cost of $68,000 w/plow. W e received $4,000 trade in against the cost of a 'Fleet Lease' return vehicle for $49,000.\n\nAll of the above purchases were accomplished using Reserve Money. Reserves accounts are funded by allocating money every year in the budget for 'Reserves' There are two Reserve Accounts. One is for Roads and the other is General Reserves.\n\nThank Y ou\n\nCLIP & SAVE\n\nUnited American Security Phone Numbers\n\nGuard House at Front\n\nEntrance 570-686-1130\n\nGuard on Duty at CLCA 800-682-4722\n\nWhen paging please advise the operator that you are calling to have the officer on duty located and provide the location where the officer is needed (i.e., your home, compactor or other location).

She gave spring the old heave ho with temperatures in May jumping from freezing to the 80's. Welcome to NEPA. Despite an early drought watch for our area we had a very wet June and ¿rst couple of weeks in July . Even with the rain work was accomplished. Roads were repaired and paved much earlier than in years past. Generally extensive road work took place in late August into September, but the Board of Directors wanted to get a jump on the work and take advantage of summer weather to allow leveling courses to cure before tar and chip was applied. Much has happened since the last issue of the Courier. Some of which you can read below.\n\nMailbox Area\n\nIn January  the mailbox area sign was illuminated. It previously did not have an on/oɱ switch and required manually pulling a plug each night. A timer was purchased and installed for illuminating the sign. The timer has a photocell allowing the sign to illuminate at dusk and remain on for six hours.\n\nThe Maintenance department completed construction and installation of a bulletin board as well as extending the ground area surrounding that and the recycle bins.\n\nRoads\n\nAs mentioned in the President's message, previously unpaved Gwinnett Road was fully paved. In addition tar and chip applications were done to Cree, Cayuga, Pine Grove and a section of Seneca.\n\nMaintenance repaired and applied new materials to unpaved roads including lower Overbrook, Junco, White Tail and W ater Lily  and performed maintenance on other non-paved roads.\n\nThis might seem a little early and you may be sitting poolside reading this now but within a couple of months may be into the throes of an early snowfall. Please be aware that we do not have a 'bare road' policy when it comes to snow removal. During minor snow events we sometimes receive inquiries as to why maintenance is not out plowing. Please understand that plows are not out immediately when snow starts to Ày.  Sometimes snow fall can last for a majority of the day however just over an inch accumulates. Anti skid applied during other snow and rain events can still be evident through the new snow. Due to the cost of materials combined with the fact that the snow amounts do not require plowing, only sides of the main and other paved roads may be cut back leaving the anti skid in the center. Social media 'experts' reporting on various other sites make it diɷcult at times.  People reporting 'horrible' conditions for various roads/highways/communities stirs up readers and other commentators when sometimes no such conditions exist. Some feel they need to see the pavement for roads to be satisfactory. A lack of traɷc combined with low temperatures can prevent roads from baring down to pavement even on the most sunny day. Unlike PennDot we do not have waves of people sitting in the wings waiting to tag team the next shift.  Our workers come in at all times, even Holidays, even after having worked a whole day earlier and do a great job with keeping our roads as safe as possible. For the record, we don't pre-treat roads in our Community.  We actually use very little salt on the roads (a one to three ratio with anti-skid). It often amazes me when I see and hear comments about salting the roads. With wells and waterways why would we want to do that? The salt has to go somewhere when it runs oɱ the road. It is also quite expensive and when temperatures get below certain points is useless.\n\nDues\n\nAll dues payment plans need to be paid up by August 28th. Gate cards are deactivated monthly for nonpayment of dues. If the account continues in this status the mailbox is locked down and then the account is referred to collections.\n\nSecurity\n\nSargent Sara Gabell and Oɷcer Aaron Duckett resgined from United American Security in early January. Sara to pursue another career and Aaron to attend college. Oɷcer Ray Kelejian was\n\nKELLY GAUGHAN\n\nRepublican Nominee for Pike County\n\nDISTRICT ATTORNEY\n\nSTRONG TRUSTED\n\nassinged by UAS to assume Sara's role when she departed. A T raining Guide for CLCA operations was assembled and given to Security personnel. In-house training was also oɱered to UAS Staɱ. The alarm panel in the oɷce which was over ten years old failed. Our alarm Company, V ector installed a new panel which was covered by our maintenance contract with them.\n\nFire Damaged Homes\n\nOne of two ¿re damaged homes on Seneca was demolished. The second of the homes remains standing but was boarded in July after multiple requests followed by a demand and threat to take legal action by our Attorney . The property was originally going to be fenced at the request of the owner's attorney but it was boarded instead.  It has been reported that the insurance company and estate for the remaining home is in settlement negotiations and the home will be eventually demolished.\n\nElectric\n\nIn an eɱort to reduce energy costs the Board approved an oɱer by Inspire Energy in February for generation charges. Since there has been inconsistent feedback regarding diɱerent energy companies, it was decided to test the oɱer for lower costs by using this company on only one of our nine meters. As of this date there has not been a remarkable diɱerence noted in the cost for the meter. W e are not bound in a contract to continue using this company and will monitor further before deciding to change back or turnover additional accounts.\n\nVolunteer Thanks\n\nMember Laura Elaro started a Poke Mon club in February which met on W ednesdays during the school year. Laura is also a Girl Scout Leader in our Community as are members Pam Wood and Debbie Boulanger. Thanks for all you do!\n\nMember Elena Luyando is always there with her camera, capturing photos for us to share. Thank you Elena for your contributions and for your important work with the Boy Scouts. Thank you to Lynn and John McCauley who also dedicate their time volunteering with the Scouts.\n\nThank you to Jessica Olcott and Barbara Hamilton along with Kristen Kelleher for getting the Easter Bunny to our Annual Easter Egg Hunt. Members of the community were treated on the last day of school. Brian and Barbara Hamilton were on hand to dish out ice cream at the Rec Building.\n\nSpecial thanks to Regina Knight, Neil Johnson, Larry Farnum, Joe Kistle, Mike Stevenson, Fred Kline and Josef Lalor for their part with helping at the Dumpster Day held in May. Fishing Day was held May 5th and it was probably one of the most beautiful weather days we have had for this event. V olunteers Neil Johnson, Eddie Calabrese, Larry Farnum, Joe Kistle and Victor Perez who are there each year along with others were once again there helping to bait hooks, remove ¿sh and untangle lines.\n\nAs of this writing, planning is under way for the CLCA Annual Picnic scheduled to be held on\n\nBSA Volunteer Recognition Dinner\n\nThe Volunteer Recognition Dinner was held March 28th at the Kuhl's Highland House. CLCA Member John McCauley received the Council President's Recognition 'For Exemplifying the Scouting Spirit of 'Selfless Service to Others' While Supporting The Primary Mission of the Hudson Valley Council of Service to Youth\n\nSaturday August 22nd. Thank you to chairpersons Michael Bulger and Lynn McCauley who along with a number of other members in the Community worked hard planning and preparing for this event.\n\nLast but certainly not least, thank you to our Board Members for their work!\n\nTax Sales\n\nFor the May Judicial Sale there were a total of seven properties in Conashaugh listed for tax sale. Not surprising but all of these lots also have delinquent dues. Currently there are eleven CLCA properties in Repository. For information regarding tax sales in Pike County go to http:// www.pikepa.org/tax.html.\n\nTrash and Recycling\n\nThere has been a sharp decline in folks leaving garbage on the ground at the compactor along with no reported incidents of folks using the recycling bins as their personal dumpsters for several months now. Some other good trash related news is that the Board approved continuing the second pick up of recycling beyond Labor Day. Recycling does have an impact on the costs for trash removal. We ask all of our members to please recycle. New signs were installed on the compactor doors which should be very clear about what not to put in the compactor and the consequences for leaving trash.\n\nDumpster day was held May 2nd. Four dumpsters used, three  were for general trash, one was for metal. Delivery cost 3 dumpsters was 225.00 each. Cost per ton for contents 75.00. Fall 2015 Dumpster Day is scheduled to take place Saturday , October 17th.\n\nA total of 11.13 tons of trash was collected (excluding metal) during Spring 2015 Dumpster Day .\n\nPennsylvania Child Protection Laws Amended\n\nFollowing a heads up by one of our members, we were noti¿ed by the Board of Health regarding requirements for anyone over the age of 14 whose job involves regular contact with children. Pool employees were required to obtain multiple clearances in order to work under this amendment. The law change also aɱected requirements for volunteers in the State who have regular contact with children.\n\nRules Reminders\n\nDogs must be kept from roaming-do not allow your dog to run at large-\n\nPermits are required to be obtained before removing any tree in excess of 1 inch\n\nPermits and/or approval from CLCA is needed for sheds, decks, extensions, roof replacement, exterior siding & painting. This is only a partial list of improvements requiring permits. Depending on what type of work you are completing you may also need a town permit. If you have any questions, please contact the oɷce.\n\nDo not leave trash on the ground if the compactor is closed or full. Please be sure your guests and/or children are aware of this rule if they are taking out your trash.\n\nLeaves and other yard debris are not permitted in the compactors.\n\nV ehicles that area not registered/inspected/ road worthy are not to be stored on members' properties. It is also a violation of Dingman Township Ordinance.\n\nInformation regarding violations and ¿nes associated with them can be found in your CLCA Blue Book. If you do not have one, please contact the oɷce for a replacement.\n\nWelcome to Conashaugh Lakes!\n\nA Happy welcome to the Hofmann family who arrived to our Community in June. Daniel and Jacqueline along with their children Daniel Jr., Alyssa, Alexa and Eliana are from North Massapequa, New York and will be living here full time.\n\nCLCA Bus Stop\n\nBY JEANNE CALABRESE\n\nWe have many new residents with children in the Community who will be using the bus stop for the ¿rst time. For those of you who are new here, our school bus lot is located in front of the CLCA Oɷce. Last year there were a total of ¿ve buses; two high school, one middle school and two elementary/primary. W e do not have a bus total for this year as of this writing. Bus schedules are mailed by the Delaware V alley School District.\n\nIt is very important to leave enough time to arrive at least ¿ve minutes before your scheduled bus. This planning is especially important in winter weather. Don't wait until the last minute to leave to only ¿nd your windshield covered in ice. Take time to clean ice oɱ your windshield properly. Driving with a plate sized port hole for a window is unsafe at best. Please stop at stop signs and do not speed. Children should be in seat belts and not hanging out of windows or a sunroof. Y ou hopefully wouldn't drive down Route 739 or 84 with kids hanging out all over or sitting in your lap; why oh why would you take a chance and do it in the Community. Accidents can and do happen here. The impact of an airbag can kill or maim your child.\n\nReminders for Bus Lot\n\nDo not park, drop oɱ or pick up students outside the bus lot. It is not safe for children or adults to be crossing exit or entrance lanes of the main entrance.\n\nParking lot lanes are one way , please follow signage\n\nParking lot speed limit is 5 mph\n\nFollow directions if and when given by Security or Bus Monitors\n\nThe bus gate exit is for buses only- no cars are to use this exit\n\nOnce a departing bus starts moving, do not attempt to stop or block it - $500 ¿ne. Bus drivers are not stopping for late arrivals\n\nProcedures for the Elementary/Primary School AFTERNOON PICK UPS ONLY- These\n\nbuses will park in the travel lane located directly behind the front Conashaugh sign instead of the bus depot to discharge students.\n\nVehicles are not permitted to move/leave the lot while these buses are present. If you arrive after the buses have entered the lot you are permitted to park in the bus depot area. Do not wait in or troll the aisles and do not pull up behind buses. Vehicles that have arrived late/parked in the bus depot will likely be the last to leave the lot. Plan accordingly.\n\nThe ¿rst days of school are exciting for parents and kids alike and there typically are more cars than normal during those days especially for the Elementary/Primary buses.\n\nThere will likely be a number of folks new to the bus stop experience. Please be kind and understanding to others and if you see someone who appears to be confused or unfamiliar with procedures, give them a hand. For your information, the phone number for the director of Transportation for DVSD is 570-296-1883.\n\nK of C Council 12571 First Sundays Dinner\n\nThe Knights of Columbus Council 12571 have been serving dinner on the ¿rst Sunday of each month since  September of 2014 at St. John Neumann Parish Hall. Those who are experiencing ¿nancial diɷculties or are in need of socialization are invited free of charge to dinner served between 2:00-4:00. Members of the Knights cook and serve the meal  restaurant-style to those attending.  A full course menu and dessert are provided. The menus vary each month such as roast beef, turkey, ham, Italian and Spanish. All are welcome. Anyone planning to attend is asked to call the parish oɷce Mon., Thurs, Fri. 775-0681 or Bob D'Elia at 7759826 on Tuesday and W ednesday.\n\n2015 Treasurer's Report\n\nBY FRED KLINE\n\nAs mentioned in my President's Report we have accomplished much this year by using monies that have been set aside over the years in our 'Reserve' funds.  In addition, some funds were used from our Capital Improvement Account to transform our latest road from unpaved to paved.\n\nCLCA uses funds from a number of accounts to accomplish everything from major purchases to day to day operations. Those accounts include Operating Accounts, General Reserves, Road Reserves and Capital Improvement.\n\nWe are fortunate to have Reserves Accounts as there are a number of associations that do not have any or only a small amount in 'Reserve'. This I discovered as a member of ' AOCA '.  AOCA is an acronym for ' Alliance of Community Associations. The Alliance   was started several years ago by our past President John Crerand. The purpose of this group is to share knowledge of various laws and techniques for accomplishing various tasks associated with being a community. Over the years much has been learned by presentations given by various invited speakers.\n\nWe also share experiences as Community leaders. It is a place where we do our best to help each other with current issues as well as hurdles that may lay in the future.\n\nThe cost of running an Association is costly and the success of doing so relies on our members paying their dues. I have been working with our dedicated oɷce staɱ in pursuing those who choose to ignore their responsibility . Many don't realize that their property deed spells this obligation out. You can't plow streets, maintain roads, trim and cut grass, maintain the pool, keep the beach clean and drainage ditches clear, repair facilities, plus the many other things that need doing without funds to do them.\n\nIn addition to the expense of labor there is the ever increasing cost of doing business.\n\nTo mention a few which all of you also have is the cost of electricity , fuel, telephones, oɷce equipment and supplies, maintenance of equipment, repair of broken gates and willful damage to property of the association.\n\nSo in closing I would like for all of you to emphasize on any and all contacts that you make at the pool, mailbox, recycle, trash, how important it is that everyone pays their share of the expense of running this Association.\n\nHaving said all that, I would like to take this opportunity to ask that you approve this year's proposed budget with its modest 1% increase. A copy of the proposed budget can be found in this publication.\n\nThank Y ou\n\nLast Day of School Ice Cream Event!\n\nThanks For Your Generosity\n\nConashaugh has been the beneficiary of a number of generous donations of materials and useable objects in recent months. Thank you Robert Kurlyck for your donation of a nice outdoor table for the picnic area.\n\nMembers Fidel and Reggie Iglesias donated a number of lounge chairs for the pool area and chairs for the office. Valerie Ferlauto and Jerry Collotti donated cabinets to our Maintenance Department for their shop and Elizabeth Herman and Anthony Mann donated several pallets of pavers. Thank you to all for your donations.\n\nCLCA ELECTIONS\n\nJOSEPH L. KISTLE\n\nMy name is Joseph L. Kistle. I have been on the CLCA Board of Directors for three years and am now running for a second term. I am the Board Liaison for the Maintenance Committee. I have also volunteered working CLCA Dumpster Days and Fishing Club events.\n\nI am a retired police detective with 28 years' experience in police work. My wife Rose and I have been married for 58 years, have 3 children and 9 grandchildren.  I am a 1955 graduate of Franklin High School, Franklin, New Jersey.\n\nAfter graduating I ventured into the work ¿eld and after many years of hard work, I became the owner/operator of a very successful business, Kistle Heating Service.  After twenty-¿ve years of owning a business, I decided it was time for a change.  W e moved to\n\nJoseph L. Kistle\n\nColorado Springs, Colorado, where I started my career in police work at the El Paso County Sheriɱ's Department as a Deputy Sheriɱ.  I was a Deputy Sheriɱ for 3 1/2 years before moving back to New Jersey due to a family illness.\n\nUpon returning to New Jersey, I continued my career in police work as a patrolman with the Ogdensburg Police Department, Ogdensburg, New Jersey, for 7 years.  I then went to the Franklin Police Department, Franklin, New Jersey, as a patrolman for 10 years and was promoted to the position of Detective Sergeant which I held for 8 years until my retirement.\n\nMy interests include hunting, ¿shing, baseball, softball, golf and football.  I played on numerous teams for many years including playing seven years semi-pro football with the Atlantic Coast League.\n\nI remain very interested in the aɱairs of the Community and would like to continue as a member of the Board.\n\nSincerely , Joseph L. Kistle\n\nBILL KING\n\nIn 2014, I 'semi-retired' and moved full time to Conashaugh Lakes with my wife, Karen.  W e love the wild life and serenity of the community .\n\nI grew up on the tide waters of the Chesapeake Bay in southern Maryland's farm country, ¿shing, crabbing, hunting and farming.  As a teenager I spent  summers working on a tobacco farm during the day while catching and selling crabs early in the morning.  I worked my way through college as an auto parts clerk and graduated from the University of Maryland with a BS in Accounting.\n\nShortly after college I joined Motorola where I spent the next 27 years.  Leaving Motorola in 2006 I subsequently worked for two other companies based out of New Y ork City, Brookwood Companies Incorporated and The New Y ork Leadership Center, Inc.\n\nBill King\n\nEmployment has kept my wife and I moving around. Beginning with my home state of Maryland, we have also lived in Chicago, Dallas, south Florida, northern New Jersey , and New Y ork City . W e hope to settle here in Conasaugh Lakes.\n\nThe biggest lesson learned over the years is to treat all people fairly , transparently , and truthfully .\n\nWe have two sons and a grandson and attend Milford Bible Church.\n\nMICHAEL BULGER\n\nMy name is Michael Bulger and I am running for the board.  I have lived in Conashaugh for nine years and have served on the board as the community's treasurer from my second year here through my seventh. I was required to take two years oɱ after serving six, so now I'm running to go back on.\n\nAs treasurer I tried to spend the community's money as carefully as I would my own, holding any increases in dues to an average of about 1% a year while I was doing it.\n\nI was part of the subcommittee that created our roads fund which has been repaving roads the last few years, and I fought against putting us into debt by spending seven ¿gures to build a new pool/clubhouse that\n\nMichael Bulger\n\nwe didn't need. Instead we spent less than a tenth of that to re-side our current pool and that should last literally for decades to come.\n\nI have also co-hosted our annual picnic in the past and am doing so again this year.  Elect me and I promise to look out for the community in the same way I did for the six years that I was on the board previously .  Thanks.\n\nCONASHAUGH LETTERS\n\nROADSIDE TRASH\n\nIncluding\tbags\tfalling\toff\tcars\t& folks\ttoo\tdarn\tlazy\tto\tgo\tback\tand get\tthem!\tKids\tand\tteens,\tinstead\tof bringing\thome\tbottles\tand\tbags\tfrom pool\tIN\tTHEIR\tBAGS,\tleave\ton roadside--very\tdisgusting\tAND\tthey DO\tNOT\tvolunteer\tfor\tclean-ups!

Coming soon to Conashaugh at the picnic area will be our own Bocce court regulation size. I don't have an exact date but I hope by our Annual Picnic. My name is Lenny Maruca and I will be the ¿rst Bocce Captain setting up teams. How this works is every Monday for ten weeks at 3:00 p.m. two teams (two people each) will play against each other. After that the best two teams will have playoɱ. There will be regulation Bocce balls that you will use.  This is just an outline. Once we know how many teams we have, more information you will receive.\n\nSome Bocce Facts:\n\nBocce Italian: A ball sport belonging to the boules sport family, closely related to bowls and pentaque, with a common ancestry from ancient games played in the Roman Empire. Developed into its present form in Italy. Bocce was initially played among Italian migrants but has slowly become more popular with their descendants and a wider community.\n\nBocce is traditionally played on natural sil and asphalt courts 27.5 meters(90 ft.) in length and 2.5 to 4 meters( 8.2 to 13.1 ft.) wide.  Bocce balls can be made of metal or various kinds of plastic. Unlike Lawn bowls, bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias.  A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three or four.  A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the jack (called a Boccino or Pallino in some areas), from one end of the court into a zone ¿ve meters(16 ft) in length ending 2.5 meters (8.2 ft.) from the far end of the court   If the ¿rst team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.\n\nThe side that ¿rst attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl ¿rst.  Once the ¿rst bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl.  From then on, the side which does not have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls.  The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame.  The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that are closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team.  The length of a game varies by region but is typically 7 to 13 points.  Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position.  Tactics can get quite complex when players have suɷcient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately . Anyone can play no matter what your age as long as you can hold the Bocce balls and understand the rules of the game. If you are interested in playing Bocce, please send me an email with the number of teams from your household. My email is lenjos@verizon.net. Please indicate 'Bocce' in the subject of the email.\n\nLATE SUMMER / EARLY FALL GARDENING\n\nFall has distinct planting bene¿ts.  Pesky pests, especially mosquitoes, retreat due to cooler temperatures.  Y ou don't need to fertilize since it promotes new growth that can be nipped in winter.\n\nThis is the prime time to prepare your yard for the next growing season.  September's cooler air temperatures are easier on both plants and gardeners.\n\nMany perennials have a head start when planted in the autumn.  It's the perfect time to get outside and transplant trees and shrubs and divide some of those spring and summer blooming perennials. The soil still retains warmth from the summer's heat encouraging root growth until the ground freezes which is often weeks or even months after the ¿rst frost hits.  Frost might seem like your biggest fall planting challenge, but actually it's not a huge problem.  Y es, frost will kill the tops of your new plants but it won't aɱect the root growth.\n\nWant free plants for your garden?  Look for fat, plump seed pods.  As they mature they swell up, stop growing and start turning brownish - that's the key sign to look for in most cases.\n\nCollect seeds by shaking them inside a paper envelope. Some of the easiest perennial Àowers to collect seeds from include:  Black-eyed Susan, Cone Àower, Meadow rue, Obedient plant, Perennial SunÀower, Perennial sweet pea, V eronica.  Once you're done collecting, write the name of the plant/ seed on the envelope and put it some place you won't forget.  A shoe box makes a ¿ne ¿le cabinet for all those envelopes.\n\nIf collecting and storing seeds is not for you, the late summer is usually bargain time as garden centers are trying to sell the last of their inventory before winter.  At the end of the season, you can ¿nd discounts on plants that have passed their peak.\n\nMost nurseries knock down prices when their perennials go out of bloom and lower them even more when the plants start looking down and out. Expect to ¿nd perennials at 50 percent or more oɱ.\n\nYou know that section in the bargain area that's super cheap and it's not hard to tell why .  I call it death row, and it's actually where I head ¿rst in the hopes of ¿nding a steal.  The plants often look pitiful, but some are still worth a shot. If it's wilted, generally sad looking or has yellowing or dying foliage, but the right price, grab it, as long as there's still some green and it's not diseased.\n\nOnce you get your bargains home, give them a thorough drink.  Set them in a tray or saucer to catch the water that pours through the potting mix and let them take their time soaking it up. Then proceed as if they were the healthiest plants in the world.  Lower temperatures and shorter days mean plants need less water, but if rain is scarce, water weekly until the soil freezes.\n\nWhen the soil freezes hard, spread a few inches of mulch around your perennials, not to prevent the soil from freezing but to keep it from thawing. Roots that aren't solidly anchored can 'frost heave' out of the soil when the ground freezes and thaws, putting the plant in danger of getting killed by cold.  Once mulch is on, you're all set.  Even if a\n\nBird Feeders!\n\nAt the Conashaugh Lakes Recreation Center, BEAR Cub Scouts Alexander and Joseph achieving #24 Be A Leader, as they serve as a denner/assistant, plan and conduct a den activity with the donation of 'build it yourself bird feeders'.\n\nfew of your new perennials don't make it, you're probably still coming out ahead.  There are so many reasons to get out and garden - take your pick.  Y our garden will love it! Happy Gardening from the Ladybug.\n\nTeach Your Children\n\nBY JEANNE CALABRESE\n\nIt's sad to report that there were a number of mischievous events that began when warm weather arrived. This acƟvity includes but is not limited to decoraƟons being removed from people's properƟes, port o johns being Ňipped over, poop being thrown into the swimming pool. I could go on. Some will say it is out of boredom, others say it is a lack of respect and some may say it's because 'there's nothing else for kids to do'. Some may think it is funny, others say disgusƟng. No maƩer what you call it, it is wrong and has consequences, perhaps not to the uncaught wrongdoer but certainly for their vicƟms. Being on the receiving end of feedback for these events I can tell you that these acts have had impacts in a number of ways. That Angel stolen from someone's lawn was in memory of a loved one and its removal devastated a young child, the squirrel removed from another property has been in that family for a very long Ɵme and can no longer be passed along, the Ňipped port -o- johns cost money to upright and that loser act of puƫng feces in the pool resulted in a lot of people not being able to enjoy a swim on what was probably one of the hoƩest days in the summer while prevenƟng four people from going to work for the day. If you get a chance discuss these examples of how a 'night of fun' can aīect others and while you are at it, take the opportunity to share some warnings with your children about some real consequences. I am not talking about being carted away by the police. It could be meeƟng up with someone who will hurt or do worse to your darling. It would probably also be a good idea to really know who your kids are allowing into the Community because dear members, you are responsible for your guests and your child's friend is your guest.\n\nFishing Day!\n\nAttention Seniors\n\nEach month the Pike County Area on Aging issues a newsletter.

On the contrary gypsy moth caterpillars are despised. They destroy foliage on\n\nselected trees, especially varieties such as oak, birch, aspen and willow all of which are here in our Community.  While trees may survive one or two years of such attacks, they generally do not survive beyond that.  There were spotty reports of damage occurring in early spring in Conashaugh, but compared to some of our neighbors to the North, we were very fortunate.\n\nIt is Pike County's plan to have a spray suppression program in 2016. It is a request based program only. This means those wishing to be included must apply for this consideration.  To qualify for the program properties must possess 250 egg masses per acre along with the trees favored by the moths.\n\nThe Pike County Conservation District held a very informative seminar regarding these pests. Board Member/Environmental Liaison Bill King and I attended the seminar held at the Pike County Communications Center in August and learned about this caterpillar's history , life cycle and procedures to be taken to be considered for the program. Our application was submitted immediately for the 2016 Program and was the ¿rst one received by PCCD following the seminar.  The next step to take place will be an oɷcial count by PCCD of egg masses in our Community. They will also be determining spray blocks.\n\nAll of these steps do not guarantee our participation in the program. First and foremost, the State needs to inform the County what if any funds will be allocated for the program and that has not been determined as of this writing. There are 17 counties including Pike that have applied for funds. Costs for spraying in 2015 ran between 26.00 and 27.00 per acre with cost sharing funds and 54.00 and 55.00 without cost sharing. It is expected these prices will increase for 2016.\n\nAt this point we have done our part to get on board the moth suppression train and anxiously await further information regarding whether or not we qualify , if there is in fact going to be a suppression program and if so, how much it will cost the Community.  Information regarding the product sprayed (BT) is available at the oɷce. We will keep you posted on developments and moth news as we receive it.

Refreshments will be served. Approximately one month before the meeting all members are mailed a ballot. Owners are permitted one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party .

Please be aware that we do not have a 'bare road' policy when it comes to snow removal. During minor snow events we sometimes receive inquiries as to why maintenance is not out plowing. Please understand that plows are not out immediately when snow starts to Ày.  Sometimes snow fall can last for a majority of the day however just over an inch accumulates. Anti skid applied during other snow and rain events can still be evident through the new snow. Due to the cost of materials combined with the fact that the snow amounts do not require plowing, only sides of the main and other paved roads may be cut back leaving the anti skid in the center. Social media 'experts' reporting on various other sites make it diɷcult at times.  People reporting 'horrible' conditions for various roads/highways/communities stirs up readers and other commentators when sometimes no such conditions exist. Some feel they need to see the pavement for roads to be satisfactory. A lack of traɷc combined with low temperatures can prevent roads from baring down to pavement even on the most sunny day. Unlike PennDot we do not have waves of people sitting in the wings waiting to tag team the next shift.  Our workers come in at all times, even Holidays, even after having worked a whole day earlier and do a great job with keeping our roads as safe as possible. For the record, we don't pre-treat roads in our Community.  We actually use very little salt on the roads (a one to three ratio with anti-skid). It often amazes me when I see and hear comments about salting the roads. With wells and waterways why would we want to do that? The salt has to go somewhere when it runs oɱ the road. It is also quite expensive and when temperatures get below certain points is useless.",

A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three or four.  A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the jack (called a Boccino or Pallino in some areas), from one end of the court into a zone ¿ve meters(16 ft) in length ending 2.5 meters (8.2 ft.) from the far end of the court   If the ¿rst team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.",

The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame.  The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that are closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team.  The length of a game varies by region but is typically 7 to 13 points.  Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position.  Tactics can get quite complex when players have suɷcient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately . Anyone can play no matter what your age as long as you can hold the Bocce balls and understand the rules of the game.

This acƟvity includes but is not limited to decoraƟons being removed from people's properƟes, port o johns being Ňipped over, poop being thrown into the swimming pool. I could go on. Some will say it is out of boredom, others say it is a lack of respect and some may say it's because 'there's nothing else for kids to do'. Some may think it is funny, others say disgusƟng. No maƩer what you call it, it is wrong and has consequences, perhaps not to the uncaught wrongdoer but certainly for their vicƟms. Being on the receiving end of feedback for these events I can tell you that these acts have had impacts in a number of ways. That Angel stolen from someone's lawn was in memory of a loved one and its removal devastated a young child, the squirrel removed from another property has been in that family for a very long Ɵme and can no longer be passed along, the Ňipped port -o- johns cost money to upright and that loser act of puƫng feces in the pool resulted in a lot of people not being able to enjoy a swim on what was probably one of the hoƩest days in the summer while prevenƟng four people from going to work for the day. If you get a chance discuss these examples of how a 'night of fun' can aīect others and while you are at it, take the opportunity to share some warnings with your children about some real consequences. I am not talking about being carted away by the police. It could be meeƟng up with someone who will hurt or do worse to your darling. It would probably also be a good idea to really know who your kids are allowing into the Community because dear members, you are responsible for your guests and your child's friend is your guest.",

If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted.\n\nCLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy . This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote.\n\nIf you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that person's position and visaversa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed by as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience.\n\nPlease note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Oɷce.\n\nPRSRT STD U.S. Postage PAID Newburgh, NY 12550 PERMIT NO. 335\n\nSUMMER 2016\n\nCLC ASSOCIATION\n\n2\n\nTABLE\n\nCONASHAUGH NEWS\n\nTABLE\n\nOUTDOOR& RECREATION\n\nGarden Tasks for August\n\n16\n\nCONASHAUGH LAKES\n\nPROPERTY OWNERS ASSOCIATION\n\n© Copyright 2016 102 Conashaugh Trail Milford, Pa 18337\n\nP: 570.686.4000 www.conashaughlakes.com\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nPresident\n\nJohn Crerand Joe Kistle Fred Kline Michael Bulger Larry Farnum Brian Hamilton Bill King Josef Lalor Bob Weed\n\nVice President\n\nTreasurer\n\nDirector\n\nDirector\n\nDirector\n\nDirector\n\nDirector\n\nDirector\n\nOFFICE STAFF\n\nJeanne Calabrese Liz Sori\n\nDawn Cuneo\n\nSECURITY\n\nSite Supervisor\n\nPUBLISHER\n\nNiki Jones Agency, Inc.\n\n39 Front Street, Port Jervis, NY 12771 P: 845.856.1266\n\nE: publisher@nikijones.com\n\nDisclaimer: The comments, statements or written opinions expressed in Conashaugh Courier are the sole responsibility of the signed individual/author and/or committee and are not edited.

There were a number of wild ¿res too close for comfort this past  spring. Burn bans were issued in the Community as well as Pike County . When a burn ban is issued, no outdoor burning is permitted regardless of whether it is in a barrel or ¿re pit. Burn bans are announced via the LOOP and Facebook.  Bans are also  posted on the lighted board in the mailbox area and on signage at the compactor and Community entrances.\n\nWhen it is safe to burn it should be in an approved location on your property and the ¿re needs to be properly contained. Burning of leaves or other yard waste on the ground is not permitted and a recipe for disaster. Permits for burning are available at no cost from the CLCA Oɷce. It is a one time permit with directions to follow for placement of your burn barrel/pit and directions to follow when burning. The Dingman Fire Department website provides burn ban status and directions to follow when burning. The website address is http://www.dingman¿re.com/Burning%20Ban.htm.\n\nRegardless of whether or not a burn ban is in eɱect  it is very important to check conditions before burning on your property. Is there  very dry vegetation or windy conditions? If so, don't burn. Keep a hose nearby and don't leave your ¿re unattended.  If you are using a barrel make sure it is entirely made of metal. It should have at least  three evenly spaced  screened vents on the side and a metal top screen. Be considerate of your neighbors when burning especially during months when windows may be open. Not many folks are fond of their home smelling like a campsite.\n\nPeople in rural areas are known to burn trash for various reasons such as avoiding to have to pay for trash removal, no existence of waste removal services or long hauls to a dump.  While burning of household trash  may be widespread in those areas, it is totally unnecessary in our Community . It is also illegal. Conashaugh rules as well as Dingman Township Ordinance prohibits the burning of trash.   Residents have more than ample accessibility to receptacles to dispose of household trash and recyclables. The burning of trash, especially plastics are dangerous to the environment and people. Please don't do it.\n\nVISA\n\nstimatel\n\nith an energy\n\non\n\nCLCA Bus Stop\n\nWe have many new residents with children in the Community who will be using the bus stop for the ¿rst time. For those of you who are new to our Community, our school bus lot is located in front of the CLCA Oɷce. As of last year there were ¿ve buses; two high school, one middle school and two elementary/primary. Bus schedules and assignments are mailed by the Delaware V alley School District to your home.\n\nIt is very important to leave enough time to arrive at least ¿ve minutes before your scheduled bus arrival. This planning is especially important in winter weather. Don't wait until the last minute to leave to only ¿nd your windshield covered in ice. Take time to clean your windshield properly .\n\nAttention Members With Dues Payment Plans\n\nFinal payments for 2015/2016 payment plans are due by August 28th. Thank you to all of our members who paid their dues. The CLCA 2015/2016 fiscal year ends September 30 2016.\n\nJAGGER ASPHALT PAVING\n\nng\n\neas\n\nDriving in the Community does not provide immunity to accidents. The same traɷc rules apply here as they would on public roads.  Please stop at stop signs and do not speed. Children should be in seat belts and not hanging out of windows or a sunroof. Y ou hopefully wouldn't drive down Route 739 or 84 with kids hanging out all over or sitting in your lap; why oh why would you take a chance and do it in the Community.\n\nReminders for Bus Time\n\n-Do not park, drop oɱ or pick up students outside the bus lot. It is not safe for children or adults to be crossing exit or entrance lanes of the main entrance. This includes late bus pick up time. Please park in the lot. Y our children will not collapse walking the extra few feet. V ehicles blocking the main entrance waiting for buses creates a hazard for those trying to exit 739.\n\nParking lot lanes are one way , please follow signage\n\nParking lot speed limit is 5mph\n\nFollow directions when given by Security or Bus Monitors\n\nThe bus gate exit is for buses only- no cars are to use this exit\n\nOnce a departing bus starts moving, do not attempt to stop or block it - 500.00 ¿ne. Bus drivers are not stopping for late arrivals\n\n-Procedures for the Elementary/Primary School AFTERNOON PICK UPS ONLY- These buses will park in the travel lane located directly behind the front Conashaugh sign instead of the bus depot to discharge students. V ehicles are not permitted to move/leave the lot while these buses are present. If you arrive after the buses have entered the lot you are permitted to park in the bus depot area. Do not wait in or troll the aisles and do not pull up behind buses. V ehicles that have arrived late/ parked in the bus depot will likely be the last to leave the lot. Plan accordingly . If you need special arrangements to depart for an appointment arrive a little early and visit the oɷce for assistance. Our bathroom is also available for your use if needed.\n\nThe ¿rst days of school are exciting for parents and kids alike and there typically are more cars than normal during those days especially for the\n\nHIS AD and SAVE\n\nHOMECENTER\n\n% OFF\n\nHARDWARE & LUMBER\n\n570-828-7312\n\nURCHASE IINIMUM $10 'STRICTIONS APPLY\n\nest\n\nMon-Sat 7:3Oam-5:3Opm Sun 8:OOam-3:OOpm\n\nElementary/Primary buses.

It has been a quiet summer thus far in our Community with the exception of a few antics.  The following is a peek of happenings in the Community since the start of our current Conashaugh year.\n\nProperties\n\nResale packets for the sale of properties were issued as follows by month:\n\nOctober: 5 for sale by owner, 2 foreclosures\n\n•\n\nNovember:   2 foreclosures\n\nDecember:  1 for sale by owner\n\nJanuary: 1 for sale by owner, 1 short sale, 1 foreclosure\n\nFebruary: 1 for sale by owner, 2 foreclosures\n\nMarch:  1 (lot) for sale by owner, 1 foreclosure\n\nApril: 0 issued\n\nMay:  1 (lot) for sale by owner\n\nJune: 1 for sale by owner\n\nJuly: 5 for sale by owner\n\nTax Sales\n\nAn upset sale was held by Pike County Tax Claim on September 23. There were 24 CLCA  properties listed for tax sale of which 6 were removed prior to the sale (taxes or a portion paid by owner). Of the remaining eighteen properties, one sold.  The new owner paid 2979.72 in delinquent taxes plus costs. Since liens do not fall oɱ properties sold at Upset sales, the owner paid Conashaugh 5253.61 for delinquent dues and other charges owed on the lot. The next scheduled upset sale is set for September 21, 2016. Currently there are 24 properties listed for CLCA. For additional information visit www. pikepa.org/taxclaim.\n\nPlow for 2012 Chevy\n\nA new plow was purchased and installed October 2, 2015. The total cost was 7461.53 tax included. A 2% discount was provided by the seller.\n\nTree Removed\n\nA very large, dead tree located on CLCA owned property at the intersection of Iroquois and Flatbrook was removed in November. The tree began shedding large sheets of bark and dead branches. Due to its proximity to wires it was necessary to hire a contractor. Four companies were contacted. W ood was left for members to take and disappeared within 24 hours. Cost for removal was 500.00 which for the size and location of the tree was extremely reasonable.\n\nRec Building & Office\n\nThe Board approved shopping for estimates to explore repairing the exterior of the Rec Building. A scope of the desired work was prepared and the search for contractors for bids began. Five contractors have conducted inspections and one has submitted an estimate as of this writing. Bids are also being secured to repair the deck at the front oɷce.\n\nCompactor Project\n\nPreliminary work began in October with an informal visit with Dingman Township personnel to develop a plan for this project and obtain paperwork needed for permits.\n\nConashaugh Lakes is requesting approval for the following lots to be combined:\n\nLot 901-A, Lot 904, Lot 905, Lot 906\n\nThe existing use for lot 901-A is the Conashaugh Lakes Community Oɷce, Bus Stop, Security Building, Mailbox and Recycling Area. Lots 904, 905 and 906 are undeveloped lots owned by Conashaugh Lakes.\n\nThe planned use for the combined lots is to relocate our existing compactor (trash collection) area and recycling to one location.\n\nOn April 13th Dave and I attended a meeting with the Dingman Township engineer to go over planning of this project. Following the meeting we returned to the surveyor for an updated  drawing to include proposed area set up and placement of compactors and recycle bins.   It was also suggested to contact Pike County Conservation to address what if any permits that might be needed from them. Unfortunately my personal life over the past few months has allowed for little to no time or opportunity to leave the community for business or otherwise. W ork on the project has resumed and visits with the needed agencies will take place in September. Updates will be shared via the LOOP and Facebook.\n\nSigns\n\nAt the suggestion of the Rules and Regulation and Security Committees, a number of diɱerent signs were requested and installed including 'Pick Up After Y our Dog'(for the front lake), Children Playing (Seneca between pool and Overbrook), Lake for Use by Residents Only(front lake) and a stop sign at the intersection of Cree and Seneca. No tailgating signs were installed at both gates.\n\nSecurity\n\nDiana Lang, previously a manager for T riple A Security , Vector and United American retired in November. Brenda Kellogg Kinzer was named as Diana's replacement and is our contact/liaison for UAS.\n\nFollowing a recommendation by the Security Committee employees of United American began parking the Security and personal vehicles in a more discreet location.\n\nSummer hours were adjusted for added, longer night patrols.\n\nBoard Appointment\n\nFollowing the September 2015 Annual Meeting there was a vacancy on the Board of Directors. Member Brian Hamilton a member of the Security and Rules and Regulations Committees was appointed to ¿ll the vacancy . Brian is currently running for the Board and his bio can be viewed elsewhere in this publication. Secretary Reggie Iglesias tendered her resignation to the Board of Directors in August. Thank you Reggie for your work as a Board Member. Larry Farnum a current candidate for the Board of Directors was appointed to ¿ll vacancy left by Reggie.\n\nCollections:\n\nSeventeen accounts were referred to collections for nonpayment of dues.\n\nRoads\n\nCrack Sealing\n\nWayco was in the community sealing cracks on Oneida (from pool to Iroquois) on Tues Nov 24 and Weds. Nov 25\n\nMiddleton, Rodney, Denege and Geronimo have all been transformed from unpaved to newly paved roads. Additional maintenance paving was done on Flatbrook, Lenape and Mohican.\n\nWhipple and Walton roadways along with an area in the ball ¿eld parking lot were damaged by vehicles doing donuts and speeding. Although there was a rash of this type of activity in early summer, it has diminished.\n\nMaintenance began widening Walton Way which is currently an unpaved road.\n\nFlatbrook Way 'Dam'\n\nIn November 2015 work began through our engineer Pennoni to address The Department of Environmental Protection's requirement to register the Flatbrook Way Dam. Criteria set by the DEP de¿ned the area as qualifying as a dam subject to registration and possible annual fees. After many months of conversation, an inspection and providing paperwork  the DEP a issued a waiver\n\nregarding registration of the dam.  Nevertheless no work can be done at the dam without permits and approval from the DEP .\n\nAs you may or may not recall, the DEP began charging private dam owners annual fees a couple of years ago. W e currently pay the DEP $800.00 annually for Conashaugh Lake Dam. Additionally, the DEP was requiring that all private dam owners pay escrow money for the purpose of breaching their dam should it become necessary (if a community were to go bankrupt). Thanks to eɱorts by Representative Rosemary Brown an alternative approach to fund a general account vs. high cost escrow for dam owners is being addressed through legislation. HB 1712 Established a Private Dam Financial Assurance Program Fund, Passed in the House and waiting for senate approval.\n\n2016 Pike County Moth Suppression Program:\n\nFindings by the Pike County Conservation District revealed that CLCA did not have the required number of healthy egg masses. The state requires there to be a minimum of 250 healthy egg masses per acre to be eligible for the spray program. This was good news as there were zero funds coming from the state to subsidize spraying.\n\nGates\n\nOur security company was contacted to see if there is any additional equipment (i.e. electric eyes) that can be installed to have gates close. There is not. There are two ways in which the gate closure is operated. 1. by loops only; once vehicle passes the gate comes down which presents a problem if vehicles have a trailer. The Loop may not pick up the tongue between trailer and vehicle and either come down between the two or on top of the trailer/whatever is being towed. 2. Timer with LOOP back up- drivers have a speci¿c amount of time in which to proceed thru the gate. If they are too slow, gate will come down and they will have to either re-swipe or re-contact member/oɷce to reopen the gate.\n\nSigns for the entrances were designed and ordered which include 'No Tailgating' and 150.00 Fine. Do not allow your guests to tailgate your vehicle. Please use a gate card for each vehicle or call your guests in from your home or through the oɷce during business hours.\n\nThe gate update project is ongoing. Please be sure to notify the oɷce of  vehicle changes. As a reminder, gate cards are periodically monitored if a car not matching a card is used, the gate card may be deactivated until updated info is provided to the oɷce.\n\nCell Tower\n\nThere has been no further response by V erizon regarding proposing a cell tower installation in the community.\n\nMaintenance\n\nEarly spring like weather allowed Maintenance to get a jump on projects . W orkers cleaned out and repaired ditch lines, the ball¿eld was groomed, trees removed, fencing repaired in the bus lot, and vehicle maintenance to name a few things. Roads\n\nwww.tashlik.com 1\n\nwere assessed for paiving and culvert pipes were replaced on roads that were to be newly paved.\n\nThank you to everyone in the community who shared kind words and sent cards during my mother's illness and after her passing. Y our support, understanding, patience and acts of kindness mean the world to me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nCLIP & SAVE\n\nUnited American Security Phone Numbers\n\nGuard House at Front Entrance 570-686-1130\n\nGuard on Duty at CLCA 800-682-4722\n\nWhen paging please advise the operator that you are calling to have the officer on duty located and provide the location where the officer is needed (i.e., your home, compactor or other location).

It's relentless.' For those of you who are Seinfeld fans,  this wasn't a mail reference,  but the thoughts of workers, who spent hours unloading trash and ¿lling forty yard dumpsters at the Maintenance Y ard for Dumpster Day that was held May 7th.\n\nThe vehicles  just kept coming and coming but thanks to our Maintenance Staɱ and a host of volunteers, approximately twenty tons of trash was collected and taken away.\n\nThis was a large increase compared to last year's spring collection which yielded slightly over eleven tons of trash.\n\nSpecial thanks to our volunteers  including Scott Bailey, Larry Farnum, Brian Hamilton, Neil Johnson, Joe Kistle, Fred Kline,  David W eed and our Maintenance Staɱ for their hard work with making this day a success.\n\nVoter Registration\n\nElection time is just around the corner!\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in PA for the November 8, 2016 election is October 11, 2016. You can register on the following website: https://www.pavoterservices.state.pa.us/pages/ VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx\n\nThe Pike County Board of Elections Oɷce is located in the County Administration Building at 506 Broad Street, Milford. Their website is  https://www.pikepa.org/elections.html.  Y ou can ¿nd downloadable forms on the site for  voter registration and absentee ballots.\n\nWhile there are two polling locations for Dingman Township,  Conashaugh residents typically  vote at the Dingman Township Volunteer Fire Department located on Log Tavern Road.\n\nSimple Math\n\nIf you do not pay your cell bill, it is turned oɱ.\n\nIf you do not pay your electric bill, it is turned oɱ.\n\nIf you do not pay your cable bill, it is turned oɱ.\n\nIf you do not pay your child's music, sports club, dance lessons bill, they don't get to participate.\n\nIf you do not pay your Master Card bill, you can't use it.\n\nWhy then is there sometimes surprise, anger even attitude when someone fails to pay dues, makes no attempt to contact the oɷce, and consequently has amenities removed and/or the account sent to collections or litigation? AT&T , Blue Ridge and local business owners can't operate for free and neither can Conashaugh Lakes.\n\nDues are very important to the daily operation and overall health of our Community. Thankfully a majority of our members pay their dues and only a small percentage fall short.\n\nThank you to all of our members who make this a priority .\n\nSip and Paint\n\nMember Ginger Jones shared her artistic talent by hosting a Sip and Paint class on Thursday April 28 at the CLCA Rec Building. Thank you Ginger for sharing your time and talent and providing a fun night to all who attended.\n\nNeed to Pay Dues?\n\nWe accept Visa, Mastercard & Discover\n\nEVERLASTING\n\nFINA N C I A L G R 0 U P\n\nHelping families live debt free & truly wealthy\n\nHow to protect your largest asset-your home, in case of death\n\nHow you can reap the potential of the stock market, without downside risk upside\n\nThe secret to maximizing your retirement benefits\n\nServing Pennsylvania & New Jersey\n\nKen Kremsner Conashaugh Resident Since 1992\n\nTo Advertise\n\nCall Nancy At The Office At\n\n845.754.2356\n\nCLCA ELECTIONS\n\nBRIAN HAMILTON\n\nMy wife Barbara and I moved to Conashaugh Lakes in June 2014 from Pompton Lakes NJ after I retired from a 36 year career as a professional pilot.

My wife Barbara has been active with the Recreation, Rules and Regulations and Communications Committees.  Last year I was\n\nBrian Hamilton\n\nappointed to ¿ll a one year vacancy on the Board of Directors.  I am running for a full three year term on the Board.  I have been fortunate and honored this past year to serve and learn alongside the other members of our Board of Directors, who hold nothing but the best interests of our community at the forefront. Having served as a member of the Board for the past year, I now feel I have the foundation to serve a full term.\n\nConashaugh Lakes is a great community and the longer my wife and I live here, the more we love it.

W e have our very own published author! Kimberly Garnick-Giarratano.  Kimberly is not just a writer, but a winner. Her book Dead and Breakfast is the winner of a coveted Kindle Scout contract.  In 2015 her book Grunge Gods and Graveyards, won the Killer Nashville Silver Falchion Award for Best Young Adult Category . She is an author of several paranormal books targeted for the young adult audience.  Graveyards are her 'thing', Kimberly tells me that she loves them. What would attract someone to a place that many of us fear?  Y ou will be surprised. V ery romantic and sentimental reasons have drawn her to cemeteries and ghosts in her lifetime.\n\nKnowing that Kimberly was drawn to 'the dark side' in her writing, I was a little apprehensive about interviewing her.  W e agreed to meet at her home.  My mind wandered for the weeks before we actually met I had heard we had an author in our community who wrote about graveyards and some of our fellow Conashaugh Lakers had led me to believe that she was one scary lady!  When I got to her home I was greeted by two beautiful children, a very happy dog and a wonderful, smiling young woman who introduced herself to me as, Kimberly , the author.  Her home was decorated - as a home - no demonic art work, no bones and cobwebs hanging from ceilings, no coɷns in the backyard or the bedroom.  Just a very warm, welcoming home ¿lled with completely and totally normal things.\n\nThe sentimental part that began her relationship with graveyards started as a young girl.   Her Grandmother and her shared some very special\n\ntime visiting lost relatives and friends at a cemetery close to her home.  Her Grandmother would tell her about their lives and explained some of the traditions that\n\nher family held close, like the placing of stones on gravestones.  Kimberly felt a connection to these people and the quiet calmness of the cemetery and she loved to be spooked.\n\nThe romantic side came from a classic book and movie, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.   (The book was written in 1945, movie in 1947 and television show 1968). This is a love story between a widow , Mrs. Muir and the ghost of Sea Captain Daniel Gregg. They were very much in love, however, they could not be together until Mrs. Muir dies.  Kimberly found this to be eerily romantic and the concept of ghosts fascinated her. She was inspired to write her own stories that would be sentimental, romantic and deadly ...or at least include graveyards!\n\nKimberly has been writing since she was a young girl growing up in Manalapan, New Jersey .  As a college student at The College of New Jersey , she was the Editor of the school paper.  Although she dedicated a forty hour week to this non paying status, she considers it to be one of her best experiences for writing.\n\nAfter college she worked as an English teacher as a Second Language teacher while she completed two Masters. One in Education and the second at Rutgers University in Library Science.  She left teaching to become a Y oung Adult Librarian in Rockaway, New Jersey .  She felt that the library was overlooking this age group and she worked hard to create an incredible program that was dedicated to attracting young people to the library .  She was very successful in this endeavor.\n\nLove did enter her life.  She married Bob for more than one reason - however when I asked about him the ¿rst thing that she told me is that he is an amazing chef, preparing chopped liver and Latkes for her. He also seems to be very cooperative\n\nabout vacationing to places with graveyards. During one of her pregnancies she ¿nally sat down to write, what would become her ¿rst published book in 2011.  Grunge Gods and Graveyards is set in 1996, a time frame that Kimberly feels close to.  The book includes locations right here in Pike County!  V ery exciting, read it and see if you recognize any of these places.  This book is the ¿rst in her The Grunge God Series, it was followed by the novella The Lady in Blue.\n\nDead and Breakfast,  part of her The Cayo Hueso Mystery Series, was inspired by her love of a graveyard she visited in Key W est, Florida. This book is ¿lled with mystery , history , ghost whisperers and, of course, a graveyard!\n\nShort stories are a great way to enjoy an evening... especially when the lights go out...Kimberly has a few for you, One Night is all Y ou Need and Brave New Girls - Tales of Girls and Gadgets.\n\nKimberly is currently working on a passion project - a slight diversion from graveyards and ghosts. There are many trials and tribulations to getting a book published and Kimberly should be writing her next book advising new authors on how to handle this.  Her advice to future writers, take creative writing courses. My advice to you, get to one of our local Libraries, Amazon or Kindle and start reading her books!\n\nWant to learn more about our famous author? www.kimberlyggiarratano.com; Facebook: KGGiarratanoAuthor; Twitter: @KGGiarratano;  kggiarratano@gmail.com\n\n.\n\nAnca Marinescu\n\nFree Ice Cream!\n\nLots of happy faces enjoyed free ice cream at the Rec Building on the last day of school.

There's nothing to do at this point but enjoy it, right? Of course not. Gardens may move more slowly in August and immediate gardening tasks, like watering and weeding, may be all you think you really need to do. It's a stand and watch month, time to keep your senses alert for weeds that need to be pulled, pests that need to be stopped, and plants that need care.\n\nTip: A natural repellent to slugs, snails, ants and other creepy-crawly bugs is coɱee grounds! They can't stand the acidity of coɱee. Sprinkling the soil a few inches from the base of plants will keep these pests away.\n\nTip: Recipe for a natural weed killer: 1 gallon of white vinegar, 1 cup table salt, 1 tablespoon liquid dish detergent funnel into a plastic spray bottle. Drench the weeds on a dry sunny day. Weeds soaked with this solution die within several days. They won't be back and nothing else will ever grow there .\n\nFlower beds?  By this point in the summer, some annuals may have become spindly or leggy. It is a good time to pinch or trim them back by as much as half their current height. They will soon begin to leaf out, look thicker and start to bloom again. Dead head Àowers to keep the blooms coming. Continue to remove faded blooms on annuals such as geraniums, marigolds, petunias, salvia, verbena and zinnias. Even the most reliable summer bloomers stage a stronger show when you faithfully remove faded Àowers.\n\nAs the fall season approaches, some of the annuals begin to feel the eɱects of their age and the weather. When mums at local nurseries are available, pull out the annuals and move mums to ¿ll in the vacancies. Geraniums? Y ou don't have to wait until fall for root cuttings to bring indoors.  Irises and poppies?  Dig up and divide roots now.  This is also a good time to prune shrubs and hedges as well as pine and ¿r trees.\n\nWater newly planted trees, shrubs, and perennials - any plants you added to your yard last fall or spring. These plants need weekly irrigation to ensure roots establish deeply . Take cuttings of plants you want to overwinter. Choices may include fuchsia, scented geranium, coleus, or wax begonia. Stick 3- to 4-inch green stem cuttings in soil. Place pots in a shaded spot, and keep soil moist.\n\nLadybug is preparing for autumn and hopes you are too.\n\nATTORNEYS AT LAW\n\nMICHAEL E.

You can work and play outside without raising your skin cancer risk by protecƟng your skin from the sun.\n\nProtecƟon from UV rays is important all year, not just during the summer. UV rays can reach you on cloudy and cool days, and they reŇect oī of surfaces like water, cement, sand, and snow.\n\nMost skin cancers are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV rays are an invisible kind of radiaƟon that comes from the sun, tanning beds, and sunlamps. UV rays can damage skin cells.\n\nHow to protect your skin from the sun\n\nYou can reduce your risk of sun damage and skin cancer by staying in the shade under an umbrella, tree, or other shelter. Your best bet to protect your skin is to use sunscreen or wear protecƟve clothing when you're outside-even when you're in the shade.\n\nShade\n\nClothing\n\nHat\n\nWhen possible, wear long -sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts, which can provide protecƟon from UV rays. If wearing this type of clothing isn't pracƟcal, try to wear a T -shirt or a beach cover -up. Clothes made from Ɵghtly woven fabric oīer the best protecƟon. A wet T -shirt oīers much less UV protecƟon than a dry one, and darker colors may oīer more protecƟon than lighter colors. Some clothing is cerƟĮed under internaƟonal standards as oīering UV protecƟon.\n\nFor the most protecƟon, wear a hat that has a brim all the way around that shades your face, your ears, and\n\nSunglasses\n\nthe back of your neck. A Ɵghtly woven fabric, such as canvas, works best to protect your skin from UV rays. Avoid straw hats with holes that let sunlight through. A darker hat may oīer more UV protecƟon. If you wear a baseball cap, you should also protect your ears and the back of your neck by wearing clothing that covers those areas, using sunscreen, or staying in the shade.\n\nSunglasses protect your eyes from UV rays and reduce the risk of cataracts. They also protect the tender skin around your eyes from sun exposure.\n\nSunscreen\n\nSunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays oīer the best protecƟon. Most sunglasses sold in the United States, regardless of cost, meet this standard. Wrap -around sunglasses work best because they block UV rays from sneaking in from the side.\n\nPut on broad spectrum sunscreen that Įlters out both UVA and UVB rays and has an SPF of 15 or higher before you go outside. Don't forget to put a thick layer on all exposed skin. Get help for hard -to -reach places like your back. And remember, sunscreen works best when combined with other opƟons.\n\nSunscreen is not recommended for babies who are 6 months old or younger. The US Food and Drug AdministraƟon recommends keeping infants out of the sun during midday and using protecƟve clothing if they have to be in the sun.\n\nSPF. Sunscreens are assigned a sun protecƟon factor (SPF), which is a number that rates how well they Įlter out UV rays. Higher numbers indicate more protecƟon. You should use a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF of 15 or higher.\n\nReapplicaƟon. Sunscreen wears oī. Put it on again if you stay out in the sun for more than 2 hours and aŌer swimming, sweaƟng, or toweling oī.\n\nThe Rules on Fireworks Safety\n\nYou know the damage fireworks can do to humans: severe burns and mangled fingers. The fact is the environment is also at risk from pyrotechnics. A firecracker flung by a 15 -year -old boy during a burn ban started a 2017 fire in Oregon ' s Columbia River Gorge that burned for three months and charred 50,000 acres. Pockets of fire were still smoldering nine months after the blaze began.\n\nThe lesson here is clear enough. You need to observe extreme care in celebrating the 4th with fireworks. Know all the dangers before you light the first fuse.\n\nThe safety Ɵps from Homeland Security come from its TransportaƟon Safety Laboratory (TSL).\n\n❖ Never place a part of your body directly over a Įrework or hold a Įrework in your hand when lighƟng.\n\n❖ Always use Įreworks outdoors and keep a bucket of water or a hose nearby in case of accidents.\n\n❖ Light only one Įrework at a Ɵme.\n\n❖ For ground -based devices such as fountains, the perimeter should be 35 feet out.\n\n❖ Designate a safe perimeter to keep people safely away from Įreworks.\n\n❖ For aerial devices, it should be 150 feet. Fireworks that don't go oī when you light them can sƟll explode.\n\n❖ Let duds sit for Įve or 10 minutes before you pick them up to dowse them in water.\n\nInclude pet safety as well as human safety in your plans. Pets find fireworks highly stressful. Bring your pets indoors, close curtains and blinds and turn on the radio to provide some distraction. Leave treats filled with food to comfort animals.\n\nKeep the weather in mind when using fireworks. Never use fireworks if your locale has a burn ban. Never set off fireworks where falling embers could ignite buildings or vegetation.\n\nHomeland Security suggests using alternatives to fireworks such as party poppers, bubbles, silly string, or glow sticks.\n\nSparklers may appear to be a safe alternative to things that go boom, but they are not. The NSC says sparklers burn at 2,000 degrees enough to melt metal. For children under five, sparklers account for half of all fireworks injuries. Keep them away from kids and use glow sticks, confetti poppers or colored streamers.\n\nFinal word on fireworks comes from the National Safety Council, which offers this as the safest way to enjoy fireworks: ' Grab a blanket and a patch of lawn. Kick back and let the experts handle the fireworks show.

Barberry family (Berberidaceae)\n\nOrigin: Japan\n\nBackground\n\n1875. Seeds were sent from Russia to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1896, it was planted at the New York Botanic Garden. It was eventually promoted as a substitute for Berberis vulgaris, an exotic plant introduced and used by early settlers from Europe for hedgerows, dyes and jams, and later found to be a host for the black stem rust of wheat.\n\nJapanese barberry was introduced to the United States as an ornamental in\n\nDistribution and Habitat\n\nJapanese barberry occurs and is reported to be invasive throughout the northeastern U.S. from Maine to North Carolina and west to Wisconsin and Missouri. It grows well in full sun to deep shade and forms dense stands in closed canopy forests, open woodlands, wetlands, fields and other areas.\n\nEcological Threat\n\nWhere it is well established, barberry displaces many native herbaceous and woody plants. In large infestations, its leaf litter causes changes in the chemistry of the soil, making it more basic.\n\nDescription and Biology\n\nPlant: spiny deciduous shrub typically to 3, but someƟmes to 6 Ō. in height; branches are deeply grooved, brown and usually have simple spines as opposed to 3 -pronged spines in exoƟc invasive European barberry ( B. vulgaris ) and the naƟve Allegheny barberry ( B. canadensis ).\n\nFlowers, fruits and seeds: Ňowering occurs in spring; abundant pale yellow Ňowers occur along the enƟre length of the stem in clusters of two to four; fruits are bright red berries about 1/3 in. long that mature July to October and persist through the winter.\n\nLeaves: small ½ -1½ inches long and shaped like small spatulas or narrow ovals, with a color ranging from green to bluish -green to dark reddish purple.\n\nSpreads: seed produced in abundance and eaten by birds like turkey and grouse and other wildlife that spread it far and wide; local vegetaƟve spread is through root creepers and Ɵp rooƟng branches.\n\nPrevention and Control\n\nDo not plant Japanese or European barberry. No biological control is available for this plant. Wearing thick gloves to protect from spines, young plants can be pulled up by hand. A Weed Wrench® can be used to uproot older shrubs when soil is moist. Shrubs can also be mowed or cut repeatedly. Treatment with systemic herbicides like glyphosate and triclopyr has been very effective\n\nAre You a Thermometer or a Thermostat?\n\nIn the realm of personal growth and self -awareness, a metaphor often used is comparing people to thermometers and thermostats. But what does this mean and which one are you?\n\nThe Thermometer:\n\nwho are like thermometers tend to mirror the emotions, attitudes and behaviors of those around them. If their environment is positive, they're uplifted.  Conversely,  if they're surrounded by negativity, their mood and actions shift to reƪect that negativity.\n\nA thermometer is a passive instrument. It reƪects the temperature of its surroundings but has no control over it. Similarly, people\n\nCharacteristics of a Thermometer Person:\n\n-Adaptive: They easily blend into their environment.\n\n-Reactive: They respond to the energy around them.\n\n-Inƪuenced: Their mood and productivity are swayed by external factors.\n\nThe Thermostat:\n\nCharacteristics of a Thermostat Person:\n\nA thermostat, on the other hand, is an active instrument. It not only measures the temperature but also adjusts it to a desired setting. People who resemble thermostats have the power to inƪuence their surroundings. They set the tone and create an atmosphere based on their internal mindset and values, rather than being swayed by external circumstances.\n\n-Proactive: They take charge of their environment.\n\n-Resilient: Their mood and productivity are determined by their internal state rather than external factors (very important characteristic)\n\n-Inƪuential: They have the ability to inspire and uplift others.\n\nWhich One Are You?\n\nReƪecting on this metaphor, ask yourself: do you tend to react to the environment around you, or do you take control and shape it? Neither is inherently right or wrong, but understanding where you stand can help you grow.\n\nTips for Becoming More Like a Thermostat:\n\nCultivate Self -Awareness: Regularly check in with your thoughts and feelings. Understand what triggers your reactions and why.\n\nSet Clear Intentions: Decide the kind of energy and atmosphere you want to create, both for yourself and those around you.\n\nPractice Emotional Regulation: Develop strategies to manage your emotions, so they don't control you.\n\nSurround Yourself with Positivity: While you should aim to inƪuence your environment, it's also wise to choose supportive and positive surroundings whenever possible.\n\nLead by Example: Demonstrate the behavior, attitude and values you wish to see in others.\n\nIn conclusion, whether you're a thermometer or a thermostat, the key is awareness and intentionality. By understanding your tendencies, you can strive to be the person who not only measures the climate but also creates it.\n\nWhich one do you resonate with more, the thermometer or the thermostat?\n\nSecurity:\n\nRules & Regulations :\n\nFinance\n\n: See Attached Report\n\nStrategic Planning : The Strategic Planning Committee has several activities in play. 1} The 2025 -2030 Strategic Plan draft is soon to be presented to the BOD for approval. It is a simplified version of the 2024 -2029 plan that is presently published on the Conashaugh Lakes Web Site.\n\nAdditionally, Jill, our new administrator and I, have been in discussions regarding several new HOA Management Software Packages, with the goal of updating our current management software. We are considering all aspects that the Conashaugh office must process such as payroll, accounting, communications, work orders, violations tracking as well as the ability for members to go on -line to obtain their current dues balance and update personal information.\n\nAfter several meetings with the Maintenance and Environmental committees we are adding a new line -item added to the strategic plan published on our community ' s Web Site. It involves a feasibility  study to relocate the swimming pool and this recreation center to higher/more geologically stable ground. The North area of our community is high ground and the community owns 50 or so lots in the North of Conashaugh. This move will require a geological study. This is a complex undertaking and you will be hearing more about this in future meetings.\n\nLastly, we have an ongoing project with the US Postal Service that reorganizes all of the mailboxes alphabetically by street name and then by street number. This should greatly reduce mail delivery errors. We are also considering enlarging the oversize partial bins.\n\nMaintenance\n\n:  Not Available\n\nRecreation : At the Recreation meeting they discussed the wonderful turn out for tickets to the picnic, There was a discussion of three upcoming outdoor movie nights. The need for volunteers is always a big topic.\n\nEnvironmental :\n\nCommunications : At our committee meeting last month we worked on the Summer Edition of the Courier. Finalized the 911 signs for the Common  Areas. Worked on advertising for the Courier. Business cards are free to Residents. And we also have our first full page advertiser!\n\nJuly Committee Briefings\n\nJill O ' Neill Administrator Report July 12, 2025\n\nPest Control SoliciƟng\n\nAnnual MeeƟng\n\nIn June, a representaƟve from Evergreen Pest SoluƟons entered the community without authorizaƟon. He stated that he had exisƟng clients within the community and that he wasn ' t soliciƟng; he was only advising the neighbors of what he was spraying so they wouldn ' t be concerned. The Evergreen representaƟve was asked to leave and not return unless he was in a commercial vehicle, had a member call the AdministraƟon Oĸce to grant him entry into the community, or the member provided him with their gate access code. I contacted the State Police; however, since there are no signs at the entrances to the community, they were unable to take any acƟon.\n\nThe Annual MeeƟng will be held on Saturday, September 27, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. at the Blooming Grove Volunteer Fire Hall located at 484 Route 739, Hawley, PA. InvitaƟons have been sent to our AƩorney, Tom Farley, and Accountant, Bradly Murray, to aƩend this year ' s Annual MeeƟng. The accountant has also been requested to receive and count mail -in ballots. As a reminder, In -person Ballots will not be accepted during the annual meeƟng.\n\nTwo cases were to be brought before the Magistrate Court for hearings on June 26, 2025. Both parƟes requested extensions. AƩorney Farley is Įling a moƟon for a 60 -day extension. If payment plans are not arranged or the defendants fail to appear in court, AƩorney Farley will wait the required 30 days for an appeal before submiƫng a judgment for the remaining balance.\n\nCollecƟons/ Files for Judgement\n\nDangerous Tree Removal\n\nGuard Shack Heater\n\nBlue Ridge Tree Service removed six hazardous trees from around the AdministraƟon Building on Friday, June 20. The cost of removing the trees was $2,000.00. The wood was leŌ behind so that community members could collect it and use it for heaƟng purposes.\n\nEsƟmates for a new heaƟng unit in the Guard Shack have been received from several HVAC companies: Laux Heat & Air at $3,000.00, Boƫni Fuel at $3,050.00, SOS at $4,405.35, and Dibo ' s HVAC at $3,000.00.\n\nI received three quotes from Tigris AquaƟc Services LLC for vegetaƟon management. One is for a single herbicide applicaƟon to eliminate vegetaƟon growing in the rip -rap of Conashaugh Lake Dam, cosƟng $1,007.00. The others are for treaƟng 6 acres of submerged weeds, including Elodea, Bladderwort, and Sago Pondweed, for $2,862.00 and Seneca Lake for $2,141.20.  Excessive growth can decrease dissolved oxygen levels during summer, leading to Įsh kills. Lake Closed for Swimming\n\nVegetaƟon Management and Lake Management\n\nThe Department of Health contacted the AdministraƟon Oĸce on June 18, advising that we had to close and prohibit swimming due to a high E. coli level caused by all the rain we ' ve received. The level has since decreased; however, we must have a single day passing sample below 235 and then go back 30 days from the collecƟon date, enter the data on a geometric spreadsheet provided by the DOH. The total E. coli level must be below 126 for the lake to reopen for swimming.

Kiley & Associates met with me, Craig Cuneo, as well as three contractors. QuesƟons were raised regarding the power source for the compactors; a site survey is to be conducted by Kiley & Associates to determine the number of trees that will need to be removed from the area. The contractor's bids will include the cost to cut and haul away the trees. Plans for a small building to monitor the area were also discussed. Kiley & Associates would like speciĮcaƟons for the self -contained dumpsters that will be placed at the new site. I contacted Eagle Equipment to see if they could provide me with the specs; I am waiƟng for Adam to get back to me to determine if a proposal for the same was ever submiƩed.

A 3% increase will take eīect at the Ɵme of renewal, increasing the current hourly rate of $27.29 to $28.11 per hour. We also discussed pricing for a three -year contract with a 2% increase for the second and third year. KRE Security LLC also submiƩed a proposal for a one -year contract at a rate of $33.00 per hour. Both proposals include a marked security vehicle, fuel, and the holiday rate is billed at Ɵme and a half.\n\nConashaugh Business\n\n07/06/2025\n\nFinancial Report June\n\nFY *24/*25 Month-End June- Dues\n\nAs of the month ending June 30, 2025, wc have collected:\n\n95.7% dues on homes 93.7% on Lots 94.8% on Contiguous Lots\n\nProperty Count February\n\n603 Homes 198 Lots 36 Contiguous Lots 58 CLCA Owned Lots 895 Total Lots\n\nBudget\n\nThe Finance Committee concluded that we will likely finish the year in the black, due to incoming old dues and payment of judgements.

This causes    bears and other predatory animals to frequent the recyclable area, causing destruction and a mess.  Do not put food trash in the recycling containers\n\nSomeone left six bags of garbage outside the locked compactor gates on the morning of July 20, 2025 at 9:35 am.  This could possibly cause predatory animals to frequent that area also so do not leave trash bags outside the compactor area.\n\nCardboard boxes must be Ʋattened put in the recycling containers.  They should NOT be put in the compactor.

The two venomous species native to the state are the Timber Rattlesnake and the Eastern Massasauga. The Eastern Copperhead is also venomous but not a rattlesnake. Timber Rattlesnakes are more common and found in 51 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, according to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.\n\nRattlesnake Species in Pennsylvania: Timber Rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus):\n\nEastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus):\n\nThis is the most commonly encountered rattlesnake in Pennsylvania. They are known for their stout bodies and variable color patterns, which can be brown or black bands on a yellow to black background, according to the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program.\n\nThis species prefers wet meadows and prairie areas, which are found in speciƤc western counties of Pennsylvania.\n\nSafety Measures\n\nIf you encounter a raƩlesnake, remain calm, avoid sudden movements, and maintain a safe distance (at least 10 feet). Do not aƩempt to kill or handle the snake, and do not throw objects at it. Alert others to the snake's presence and keep children and pets away. If biƩen, seek immediate medical aƩenƟon.\n\nSafety Tips\n\nPanicking can lead to sudden movements that may startle or provoke the snake.\n\nStay Calm:\n\nMaintain Distance:\n\nDon't Provoke:\n\nRattlesnakes typically strike when they feel threatened, so keeping a safe distance (at least 10 feet) is crucial.\n\nAvoid throwing objects, attempting to move the snake, or otherwise disturbing it.\n\nLet other people in the area know about the snake's location and advise them to proceed with caution. Keep Pets and Children Away:\n\nAlert Others:\n\nEnsure children and pets are kept at a safe distance from the snake.\n\nIf bitten, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nSeek Medical Attention:\n\nIf you hear a rattle:\n\nsafely back away, do so. On Trails:\n\nStop and locate the sound before reacting. If you can\n\nStay on designated trails, avoid tall grass, and be aware of your surroundings. Keep your dog on a leash.\n\nIf the snake doesn't move oơ the trail, it's often best to wait it out or turn back.\n\nIf it doesn't move:\n\nINFECTED BLACKLEGGED (DEER) TICKS ADULT FEMALE VS- NYMPH\n\nsince April 2020 a cotal of 21,469 Blacklegged ticks were tested for Lyme disease.\n\nWe're still in the thick of nymph season in PA! Even though nymph ticks are infected at lower rates than adults, we still consider them the riskiest. Their small size makes them hard to see, meaning they often stay attached for longer. The longer a tick is attached, the more likely they are to transmit illness.\n\n2023 Pennsylvania Data:\n\nINFECTED BLACKLEGGED (DEER) TICKS ADULT FEMALE VS NYMPH\n\nWhat could be the downside of criticizing my HOA ' s Board of Directors?\n\nCriticizing your community and its Board of Directors on Facebook can have significant downsides, both for individuals and the broader community.  Social media posts are often permanent and highly visible, making it easy for offhand or poorly worded criticisms to cause lasting reputational harm that could impact home prices.  It could impact how contractors view doing business with the community. It could impact the relationship that the community has with its banker and insurance provider.  For example,  let ' s  imagine  that  someone  in  the  community  posted  a  negative  comment  about  the management of a CLCA project and for some reason the project ended up in a legal dispute.  That criticism  may  become  evidence  that  the  insurance  company  uses  as  justification  to  raise  the premium for the community.  Who suffers -the homeowners that pay (as a part of their dues) the Insurance premium.  So, think before you post.\n\nAlso,  unlike  face -to -face  conversations,  online  comments  lack  the  immediate  feedback  of  body language and tone, which can lead to misunderstandings, misquotes, and sweeping generalizations that distort the truth and escalate tensions.  This dynamic can result in ruined reputations, damaged relationships, and can lead to legal proceedings, if the posts become harassment or slanderous.  It actually strikes me as a bit cowardly to use the anonymity and distance provided by social platforms to embolden oneself to be aggressive and unkind.\n\nCriticism  of  our  community  and  its  board  of  directors  on  Facebook  can  undermine  trust  in  the community  leadership,  erode  the  community  fabric,  and  sow  disunity  among  residents.    Social media  debates  can  quickly  devolve  into  factionalism,  with  personal  attacks  and  misinformation fueling open conflict rather than constructive dialogue.  This not only distracts board members from their responsibilities but also makes it harder to resolve issues effectively.  Furthermore, viral posts can attract attention beyond the community, exposing sensitive matters to outsiders and increasing the  risk  of  reduced  reputation  and  influence  for  both  individuals  and  our  community  as  a  whole. Ultimately, while transparency and accountability are important, airing grievances on Facebook often does more harm than good.  We need our board of directors, our volunteers, and the members of our          community (especially those with leadership training) to help put a stop to the offensive Facebook posts.  We will all benefit ethically and financially.\n\nA more constructive alternative to Facebook would be to volunteer to join and bring your perspective to committees, routinely attend committee and board meetings, and civilly engage with members of the board.  If you are already a volunteer, please consider what you post and its impact before you post it!\n\nJohn A. Thies Rules & Regulations Liaison\n\nThe BeneĮts of Volunteering: Why You Should Get Involved in Your Community\n\nVolunteering is one of the most rewarding acƟviƟes you can engage in, both for yourself and for your community. Whether you ' re lending a helping hand at the annual picnic, parƟcipaƟng in a community cleanup, or helping the kids do an art project, the beneĮts of volunteering are abundant. Here are some compelling reasons to consider geƫng involved:\n\n1. Make a PosiƟve Impact\n\nOne of the most signiĮcant beneĮts of volunteering is the opportunity to make a diīerence in the lives of others. Your Ɵme and eīort can help improve your community, support those in need, and create a more inclusive environment. Knowing that your acƟons contribute to a greater cause can be incredibly fulĮlling.\n\n2. Build ConnecƟons\n\nVolunteering allows you to meet new people who share your interests and values. You ' ll have the chance to connect with fellow volunteers, community members, and even those you ' re helping. These relaƟonships can lead to lasƟng friendships, a stronger support network, and a greater sense of belonging in your community.\n\n3. Learn New Skills\n\nWhen you volunteer, you oŌen have the opportunity to learn and develop new skills. Whether it ' s project management, communicaƟon, or even speciĮc skills like gardening or teaching, volunteering can enhance your resume and prepare you for future opportuniƟes. Plus, it ' s a great way to explore new interests!\n\n4. Boost Your Mental Health\n\nNumerous studies have shown that volunteering can improve mental health. Helping others can reduce stress, combat depression, and increase feelings of happiness and saƟsfacƟon. The sense of purpose that comes from giving back can lead to greater overall well -being.\n\n5. Gain a New PerspecƟve\n\nVolunteering exposes you to diīerent experiences and viewpoints that you might not encounter in your daily life. This can lead to greater empathy and understanding, helping you appreciate the diversity within your community. It can also inspire you to take acƟon in other areas of your life.\n\n6. Enhance Your Community\n\nWhen you volunteer, you contribute to the beƩerment of your community. Your eīorts can lead to cleaner parks, more accessible resources for those in need, and programs that support educaƟon, health, and well -being. Together, volunteers can create a stronger, more vibrant community for everyone. Create LasƟng Memories\n\nThe experiences you gain through volunteering can be some of the most memorable moments of your life. From organizing events to parƟcipaƟng in community acƟviƟes, you ' ll create stories and memories that you can cherish for years to come. Get Involved Today!\n\nWith so many beneĮts to gain, it ' s Ɵme to take the plunge and get involved in your community. Look for commiƩees or events that resonate with you, and don ' t hesitate to reach out. Whether you have a few hours or a long -term commitment to oīer, your contribuƟon can make a signiĮcant diīerence.\n\nVolunteering is not just about helping others; it ' s about enriching your own life in the process. So why wait? Join the movement of community volunteers and experience the joy and fulĮllment that comes from giving back!\n\nThis page was left blank intentionally\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause we need you to be a Conashaugh Volunteer!\n\nRecreation needs volunteers for events large and small.\n\nDo you have an interest you would like to share with an article in The Courier?

You might get a free comedy show. These berry frozen yogurt cubes blend fun and antioxidants. Win -win.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1/2 cup blueberries\n\n1/2 cup strawberries (hulled and chopped)\n\n1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n\nDirections:\n\nBlend berries and yogurt until beautifully purple and creamy.\n\nPour the mixture into ice molds-in whatever ridiculous shapes you want.\n\nFreeze for at least 4 hours.\n\nConfession: These are actually pretty tasty for humans, too (but don ' t tell your dog).\n\nFrozen Banana Cat Treats\n\nRipe bananas Cat treats Catmilk such as Whiskas Catmilk\n\nPeel and Slice the Bananas: Start by peeling the ripe bananas and cuƫng them into small, bite -sized pieces. This makes it easier to blend later.\n\nPlace Cat Treats in Ice Cube Tray: You will put the cat treats in the boƩom of the tray.\n\nBlend the Bananas: Place the banana slices into a blender or food processor and add the Catmilk. Blend unƟl you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. You will make at a raƟo of one banana to one Catmilk container.\n\nPour into Ice Cube Tray: Once you have your banana -Catmilk puree ready, pour it into the ice cube tray over the cat treats.\n\nServe: When the treats are fully frozen, remove them from the tray and oīer one to your cat. Keep the remaining treats stored in an airƟght container in the freezer.\n\nFreeze: Place the Įlled mold in your freezer and let it freeze for a few hours or unƟl the treats are solid.\n\nLet ' s have some fun making glue suncatchers\n\nIngredients You ' ll Need\n\n1 plasƟc lid (such as from a yogurt or sour cream container)\n\nA few drops of food coloring (various colors)\n\nClear school glue (enough to cover the boƩom of your lid)\n\n1 toothpick (for swirling the colors)\n\n1 piece of ribbon, string, or Įshing line (for hanging)\n\n1 hole punch (to make a hole for hanging)\n\nStep -by -Step Instructions\n\nBegin by choosing a plasƟc lid that will act as the base for your suncatcher. Clean it thoroughly and dry it completely.\n\nAŌerward, carefully add several drops of food coloring into the glue. You can opt for one color or mulƟple to create a rainbow -like eīect.\n\nNext, pour clear school glue into the lid unƟl it covers the enƟre boƩom. Gently Ɵlt the lid if needed to spread the glue evenly.\n\nThen, take your toothpick and gently swirl the food coloring through the glue. Be careful not to overmix, so the colors remain disƟnct and don ' t muddy.\n\nOnce fully dry and Įrm, remove the suncatcher from the lid. It should peel away easily. If it sƟcks, gently Ňex the lid to loosen it.\n\nNow, set the lid aside in a safe, level place to dry. Depending on the glue ' s thickness and humidity levels, drying could take anywhere from 8 to 24 hours.\n\nUse a hole punch to make a hole near the top of your suncatcher.\n\nFinally, thread your ribbon or string through the hole, Ɵe a knot, and hang your suncatcher in a sunny window to admire the vibrant colors shining through!\n\nCongratulations\n\nConashaugh ' s Person of the Month Dawn Cueno\n\nHave you witnessed a member of the Maintenance Crew going out of their way to make our community a better place?\n\nOr did you have an amazingly pleasant experience with one of our wonderful Ladies in the o ܬ ce ?\n\nWhat about an amazing Member?
