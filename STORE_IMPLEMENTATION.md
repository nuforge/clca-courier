# Store and Data Management Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive store and data management system for The Courier website that tracks site states and manages data efficiently.

## What was implemented:

### 1. Site Store (`site-store-simple.ts`)

- **State Management**: Uses Pinia for reactive state management
- **Dark Mode**: Integrated with Quasar's dark mode system
- **Data Storage**: Currently uses hardcoded data (easy to switch to API)
- **Types**: Fully TypeScript typed for better development experience

### 2. Core Features

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Button in header that persists across navigation
- **Active Navigation States**: Proper styling for current page in sidebar
- **Responsive Data**: All data is reactive and updates across components
- **Theme Integration**: Proper dark/light mode colors using Quasar variables

### 3. Data Structure

The store manages several types of data:

- **News Items**: Articles with categories (news, announcement, event)
- **Classifieds**: Community marketplace items with categories
- **Events**: Community events with dates and details
- **Community Stats**: Household count, lakes, etc.

### 4. Store Architecture

```typescript
// State
isDarkMode: boolean
newsItems: NewsItem[]
classifieds: ClassifiedAd[]
events: Event[]
communityStats: CommunityStats

// Computed (automatically filtered/sorted)
featuredNews: NewsItem[]
recentClassifieds: ClassifiedAd[]
upcomingEvents: Event[]

// Actions
toggleDarkMode()
setDarkMode(value)
```

### 5. Component Integration

- **MainLayout**: Uses store for dark mode and navigation state
- **IndexPage**: Displays dynamic data from store instead of hardcoded text
- **Future pages**: Easy to connect with `const siteStore = useSiteStore()`

## Future API Integration

The current implementation uses hardcoded data but is structured to easily switch to real APIs:

### Option 1: Simple JSON Files (current approach)

- Data stored in `src/data/*.json` files
- Easy to edit and maintain
- Good for small datasets
- Fast loading

### Option 2: API Service (prepared structure)

The `api-service.ts` shows how to structure API calls:

```typescript
// Current: import('../data/news.json')
// Future: fetch('/api/news').then(r => r.json())
```

### Option 3: Real Database/CMS

- Connect to headless CMS (Strapi, Contentful, etc.)
- Database with REST/GraphQL API
- Admin interface for content management

## Key Benefits

1. **Centralized State**: All site data in one place
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support prevents errors
3. **Reactive Updates**: Changes automatically reflect across components
4. **Dark Mode**: Fully integrated with Quasar's theme system
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new data types and features
6. **Performance**: Computed values cache automatically
7. **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Data**: Add more news articles, classifieds, events
2. **Add Features**: Search, filtering, pagination
3. **Admin Interface**: Content management system
4. **Real API**: Connect to backend service when ready
5. **Caching**: Add local storage persistence
6. **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline reading

The foundation is solid and ready for expansion!
