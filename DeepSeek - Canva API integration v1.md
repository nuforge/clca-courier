Of course. This is an excellent way to approach a complex feature. Here is a series of incremental, phased prompts designed for an AI coding assistant to help you implement the Canva Connect integration into your Vue3/Quasar/Firebase app. Each phase builds upon the last, focusing on small, testable units of work.

---

### **Foundation Phase: Setup & Data Modeling**

**Goal:** Configure the environment and refactor the data structure to be Canva-aware.

**Prompt 1: Environment & TypeScript Foundation**
"Create a new file `/src/services/canva/types.ts`. Define strict TypeScript interfaces for the core Canva-related data structures we will use:
1.  `CanvaDesign`: with fields `id` (string), `editUrl` (string), `exportUrl` (string | null), and `status` (literal union type: 'draft', 'pending_export', 'exported', 'failed').
2.  `CanvaComment`: with fields `id` (string, use Firebase's `@documentId` in a subcollection later), `authorId` (string), `text` (string), and `createdAt` (Firestore timestamp).
3.  `Contribution` (refactor): Extend our existing Contribution interface to include a `canvaDesign: CanvaDesign` field and a `comments` field that is a subcollection of `CanvaComment`. Ensure all fields are optional where appropriate for the draft state.
4.  Create a `.env` file (and a `.env.example`) with variables for `VITE_CANVA_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_CANVA_APP_ID`, and a placeholder for `VITE_CANVA_API_REDIRECT_URI`. We will get the actual values from the Canva Developer portal."

**Prompt 2: Firebase Firestore Rules & Security**
"Based on the new `Contribution` interface, write a set of robust Firebase Security Rules for the `contributions` collection. The rules must enforce:
1.  Users can only create a new contribution document if they are authenticated.
2.  A user can only read, update, or delete a contribution if they are the `authorId` OR if their role (from the `users` collection) is 'editor' or 'admin'.
3.  The `canvaDesign.status` field can only be updated to 'pending_export' or 'failed' by the author. It can only be updated to 'exported' by a user with an 'editor' or 'admin' role.
4.  Comments can be added by the author or an editor/admin. A user can only delete their own comments.
Write these rules and also create a basic Vitest suite using the `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` library to verify these access control rules work correctly."

**Prompt 3: Canva API Service Layer**
"Create a foundational Canva API service file at `/src/services/canva/api.ts`. Use axios to create a configured API client instance. It should:
1.  Read the `VITE_CANVA_API_BASE_URL` from the environment.
2.  Include a function to set an authentication token (we will implement OAuth flow later).
3.  Define typed functions for the key API calls we'll need (leave them as stubs for now):
    -   `createDesignFromTemplate(templateId: string): Promise<{ designId: string, editUrl: string }>`
    -   `exportDesign(designId: string): Promise<{ exportUrl: string }>`
    -   `getDesign(designId: string): Promise<CanvaDesign>`
Write accompanying Vitest tests for this service file, mocking axios to test the request/response shapes."

### **Core Integration Phase: OAuth & Design Lifecycle**

**Goal:** Implement the authentication flow and the core ability to create and open a design.

**Prompt 4: OAuth 2.0 Authentication Flow**
"Implement the Canva OAuth 2.0 'Authorization Code' flow in a new composable: `/src/composables/useCanvaAuth.ts`.
1.  The composable should provide functions: `initiateOAuth()` and `handleOAuthRedirect()`.
2.  `initiateOAuth()` should redirect the user to Canva's OAuth endpoint, passing our `app_id` and the `redirect_uri`.
3.  `handleOAuthRedirect()` should be called on the page we specified as our `redirect_uri`. It must parse the `code` from the URL query parameters, exchange it for an access token via a secure Cloud Function (describe the function we need to write next), and store the token securely (e.g., in a Pinia store or a secure cookie).
4.  Write a simple Quasar page component for the redirect URI that calls this composable's `handleOAuthRedirect` method on mount and shows a loading state."

**Prompt 5: Backend Token Exchange (Cloud Function)**
"Write a Firebase HTTPS Cloud Function to securely exchange the OAuth `code` for an `access_token`.
1.  The function should be triggered by a POST request.
2.  It should take the `code` from the request body.
3.  It should then make a server-to-server request to Canva's `https://api.canva.com/oauth/token` endpoint, providing our app's `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uri`, and the `code`.
4.  The function must return the `access_token` and `refresh_token` to the frontend. Handle errors gracefully.
Write a unit test for this Cloud Function using the Firebase Functions test framework."

**Prompt 6: Create and Open Design Workflow**
"Implement the core design workflow in a new composable: `/src/composables/useCanvaDesign.ts`.
1.  Create a function `createNewDesign(contributionId: string, templateId: string)`. It should:
    a) Call our Canva API service's `createDesignFromTemplate` method (now implementing the actual API call with the stored auth token).
    b) On success, update the Firestore `contribution` document with the new `canvaDesign` data (id, editUrl, status: 'draft').
2.  Create a function `openDesign(editUrl: string)`. It should open the provided `editUrl` in a new browser window/tab using `window.open(editUrl, '_blank')`.
3.  Integrate this composable into a existing 'Contribution' Quasar page. Add a button that calls `createNewDesign` and then `openDesign` for the user."

### **Enhanced Collaboration Phase: Comments & Export**

**Goal:** Implement bi-directional sync for comments and the export flow for approved designs.

**Prompt 7: Real-time Comment Syncing with Firestore**
"Refactor the `Contribution` page to listen for real-time updates on its comments subcollection.
1.  Use a Firestore `onSnapshot` listener on the `contributions/{id}/comments` subcollection.
2.  Map the comments to a reactive `ref` array in the component.
3.  Create a form to add a new comment. The `addComment` function should add a new document to the comments subcollection with the `authorId`, `text`, and `createdAt` timestamp.
4.  Style the comments to clearly distinguish between the current user's comments and others'.
Write a Vitest test for the component that mocks the Firestore `onSnapshot` to simulate receiving a new comment."

**Prompt 8: Design Export & Status Management**
"Implement the export flow for editors.
1.  On the 'Contribution' page, add an 'Export for Print' button that is only visible for users with an 'editor' or 'admin' role.
2.  The button click handler should:
    a) Call the Canva API service's `exportDesign` function with the `designId`.
    b) Immediately update the local Firestore document to set `canvaDesign.status` to 'pending_export'.
    c) Poll the Canva API (or use a webhook later) to check if the export is ready. Once the `exportUrl` is available, update the Firestore document with the URL and set `status` to 'exported'.
3.  The UI should show a loading spinner while the status is 'pending_export' and a download link when it is 'exported'."

### **Advanced Integration Phase: Google Drive & UX**

**Goal:** Implement the external hosting feature and polish the user experience.

**Prompt 9: Google Picker Integration Component**
"Create a new Quasar component `GoogleDrivePicker.vue`.
1.  It should implement the Google Picker API as described in our previous conversation.
2.  The component should emit a `file-selected` event with the selected file's metadata (`id`, `name`, `webViewLink`) when a user selects a file.
3.  Integrate this component into the 'Contribution' page, next to the comment form. When a file is selected, add a comment that says, `"User attached a file from Google Drive: [file name] - [link to file]"`. This links the external asset to the discussion thread."

**Prompt 10: User-Friendly Workflow & Onboarding**
"Improve the UX based on modern best practices.
1.  Create a `UserOnboarding.vue` component that uses Quasar's `QStepper` component. The steps should be: 1) Connect Canva Account, 2) Connect Google Drive, 3) Review Tutorial.
2.  Create a `GuideModal.vue` component that can be triggered from a 'Help' button. It should display a simple, illustrated guide on 'How to contribute a article using Canva'.
3.  Implement empty states on the 'Contributions' page: if the user has no contributions, show a button that links to the onboarding flow.
4.  Throughout the app, add clear, actionable loading states, success notifications (using Quasar's `QNotify`), and error messages."
