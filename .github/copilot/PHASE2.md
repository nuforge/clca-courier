# ROLE-BASED DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT - PHASE 2

## 🎯 CURRENT OBJECTIVE
Implement Vue Router guards with role-based access control

## 🔒 MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS
- Build on existing router (src/router/index.ts, src/router/routes.ts)
- NO breaking changes to current routes
- Redirect to appropriate dashboards
- Accessibility-compliant loading states

## 📁 FILES TO MODIFY
1. `src/router/guards/role-guard.ts` - New route guard
2. `src/router/index.ts` - Register guard
3. `src/router/routes.ts` - Add dashboard routes

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Role-based route protection
- [ ] Automatic dashboard redirects
- [ ] Loading states during permission checks
- [ ] Fallback routes for unauthorized access
- [ ] Integration with existing auth guard

FOCUS: Navigation security - NO dashboard UI yet
