# CLCA Courier - Development Task Checklist

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES 🚨

### NEVER DO THESE (USER ENFORCED PROHIBITIONS)

❌ **HASH MODE ROUTING** - Application uses history mode only

- ✅ **CORRECT**: `http://localhost:9000/archive`
- ❌ **WRONG**: `http://localhost:9000/#/archive`

❌ **HARDCODED DATA LISTS** - No static arrays, JSON files for content, or fake data

- ✅ **CORRECT**: Dynamic discovery from actual files
- ❌ **WRONG**: Arrays of PDF filenames or newsletter objects

❌ **ASSUMING PATHS/FILES** - Always verify before implementing

- ✅ **CORRECT**: Use `list_dir`, `file_search` to check existence
- ❌ **WRONG**: Guessing directory structures or file locations

### MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES

✅ **DYNAMIC EVERYTHING** - All content must be discovered from actual files
✅ **VERIFY FIRST** - Check paths, directories, and files before referencing
✅ **HISTORY MODE** - Always use history mode routing, never hash mode

## � MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### **ESLINT/TYPESCRIPT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT**

> **⚠️ ALL TASKS MUST INCLUDE ESLINT VERIFICATION AS FINAL STEP**

**Critical Rule:** Every coding task must end with ESLint/TypeScript error verification and resolution.

**Required Workflow for ALL code changes:**

1. Implement feature/fix
2. Run `get_errors` tool on modified files
3. Fix any TypeScript/ESLint issues found
4. Re-verify until clean
5. Only then mark task as complete

**Prohibited Practices:**

- ❌ Using `any` type without justification
- ❌ Missing type imports for external interfaces
- ❌ Declaring tasks complete while ESLint errors exist
- ❌ Suggesting code without considering TypeScript compliance

**Required Practices:**

- ✅ Always import required types (`NewsletterMetadata`, etc.)
- ✅ Use proper TypeScript interfaces for all objects
- ✅ Verify compilation before task completion
- ✅ Proactively prevent common typing issues
