## ÔøΩ MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### **ESLINT/TYPESCRIPT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è ALL TASKS MUST INCLUDE ESLINT VERIFICATION AS FINAL STEP**

**Critical Rule:** Every coding task must end with ESLint/TypeScript error verification and resolution.

**Required Workflow for ALL code changes:**

1. Implement feature/fix
2. Run `get_errors` tool on modified files
3. Fix any TypeScript/ESLint issues found
4. Re-verify until clean
5. Only then mark task as complete

**Prohibited Practices:**

- ‚ùå Using `any` type without justification
- ‚ùå Missing type imports for external interfaces
- ‚ùå Declaring tasks complete while ESLint errors exist
- ‚ùå Suggesting code without considering TypeScript compliance

**Required Practices:**

- ‚úÖ Always import required types (`NewsletterMetadata`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Use proper TypeScript interfaces for all objects
- ‚úÖ Verify compilation before task completion
- ‚úÖ Proactively prevent common typing issues
