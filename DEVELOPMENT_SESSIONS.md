# CLCA Courier - Development Sessions Log

## Session: September 7, 2025 - Sync Functionality Fixes

### Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE

Individual sync operations improved but core issue remains: synced items disappear from UI instead of appearing in main list.

### Critical Fixes Completed

✅ **Firebase Data Matching Bug**: Changed from ID-based to filename-based matching in `useContentManagement.ts`
✅ **Mass PDF Processing Elimination**: Implemented `refreshFirebaseDataOnly()` for surgical refresh
✅ **Thumbnail URL Issues**: Fixed localhost hardcoding in URL generation
✅ **TypeScript Type Safety**: Eliminated `any` types, proper `Record<string, unknown>` usage
✅ **Versioning Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive newsletter versioning system

### Key Files Modified

- `src/composables/useContentManagement.ts` - Fixed Firebase data matching
- `src/pages/CombinedNewsletterManagementPage.vue` - Surgical refresh implementation
- `src/services/firebase-firestore.service.ts` - Versioning support added
- Multiple versioning system files created

### Outstanding Issues (Next Session)

❌ **Sync UI State Management**: Items disappear from UI after sync instead of moving to main list
❌ **Draft→Firebase→Main Integration**: Data flow needs debugging
❌ **Reactivity After Sync**: UI doesn't reflect successful sync operations

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Filename-based Matching**: Filenames are the stable identifier across all systems
- **Surgical Refresh Pattern**: Avoid full data reloads during sync operations
- **Firebase-First Architecture**: All data operations go through Firebase services
- **No Mass PDF Processing**: Prevent performance cascades during sync

### Next Session Priority

1. Debug why synced items don't appear in main list
2. Fix UI reactivity after sync operations
3. Test comprehensive sync workflows
4. Validate data flow: Draft → Firebase → Main list

### Development Commands Run

- Multiple TypeScript service enhancements
- Firebase data flow debugging
- UI state management investigation
- Performance optimization implementation

**Development Note**: Sync functionality partially working but not user-visible. Core data operations successful, UI integration needs work.
