## üìã TEST SUITE COMPLETION SUMMARY (January 2025)

### Major Issues Resolved & Solutions Implemented

#### 1. **Firebase Mocking Issues**
**Problem:** Tests failing due to missing `Timestamp` and `GeoPoint` mocks in Firebase Firestore tests
**Solution:** Added comprehensive Firebase Firestore mocks with proper `Timestamp` and `GeoPoint` implementations

#### 2. **Vue Component Import Issues**
**Problem:** Component tests failing due to missing `ref`, `defineEmits` imports
**Solution:** Added proper Vue imports to component test files

#### 3. **Quasar Component Mock Issues**
**Problem:** Tests failing due to missing `QCardActions` and other Quasar component mocks
**Solution:** Added comprehensive Quasar component mocks for all required components
