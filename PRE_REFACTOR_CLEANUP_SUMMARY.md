## 🎯 Ready for Major Refactor

The codebase is now in optimal condition for the planned content management refactor:

1. **Clean naming**: Generic component names ready for new architecture
2. **Organized docs**: Historical context preserved but out of the way  
3. **No technical debt**: All TODO items addressed or properly documented
4. **Consistent patterns**: Standardized imports and naming conventions
5. **Updated references**: All file renames properly propagated

The cleanup ensures the upcoming Firebase content management refactor can proceed without legacy naming conflicts or outdated documentation interfering with the new architecture.
