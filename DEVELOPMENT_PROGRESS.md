# CLCA Courier - Development Progress Summary

**Last Updated:** September 7, 2025  
**Branch:** sync  
**Current Session:** Sync functionality fixes (ONGOING - HAS KNOWN ISSUES)

## üö® CRITICAL STATUS

### ‚ùå KNOWN ISSUES (NOT RESOLVED)

- **Sync functionality is NOT working as intended**
- Individual sync button behavior issues remain
- Data flow between drafts and main newsletter list needs attention
- These issues will be addressed in the next development session

## ‚úÖ RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS (This Session)

### Data Architecture Fixes

- **Fixed critical Firebase data matching bug**: Changed from ID-based to filename-based matching
- **Enhanced thumbnail URL generation**: Fixed localhost hardcoding issues
- **Implemented surgical Firebase refresh**: Avoids mass PDF processing during sync operations
- **Type safety improvements**: Proper TypeScript casting throughout data flow

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Collapsible bulk actions**: Eliminated UI jumping with q-expansion-item
- **Reserved space contextual bar**: Fixed jumping contextual action bar
- **Enhanced file state management**: Better status detection and re-import workflows
- **Removed automatic tag pollution**: Cleaned up auto-generated tags like "DRAFT", "IMPORTED"

### Performance Optimizations

- **Eliminated mass PDF processing**: Sync operations no longer trigger processing of all local PDFs
- **Faster sync operations**: Reduced unnecessary system-wide operations
- **Targeted data refresh**: Only updates necessary data without full system reload

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE STATUS

### Data Flow (PARTIALLY FIXED)

```
Local PDFs (public/issues/)
    ‚Üì (lightweightNewsletterService)
Base Newsletter Data
    ‚Üì (useContentManagement)
Merged with Firebase Metadata (BY FILENAME ‚úÖ)
    ‚Üì
Main Newsletter List

Draft Storage (localStorage)
    ‚Üì (sync functions)
Firebase Metadata (ISSUES REMAIN ‚ùå)
    ‚Üì (should appear in main list)
Main Newsletter List (SYNC ISSUES ‚ùå)
```

### Core Services Status

- ‚úÖ **lightweightNewsletterService**: Local PDF discovery working
- ‚úÖ **firebase-firestore.service**: Metadata operations working
- ‚úÖ **useContentManagement**: Data merging improved (filename-based)
- ‚ùå **Sync operations**: Draft‚ÜíFirebase‚ÜíMain list flow has issues
- ‚úÖ **Thumbnail generation**: URL issues resolved

## üìù TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Key Files Modified

- `src/composables/useContentManagement.ts`: Fixed Firebase data matching logic
- `src/pages/CombinedNewsletterManagementPage.vue`: Sync function improvements
- `src/services/firebase-firestore.service.ts`: Enhanced with versioning support
- Various type definitions and service improvements

### Critical Bug Fixes

1. **Firebase Data Matching**: Changed from `n.id === fbMeta.id` to `n.filename === fbMeta.filename`
2. **Thumbnail URLs**: Removed `window.location.origin` hardcoding
3. **PDF Processing Prevention**: Surgical refresh functions to avoid mass processing
4. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript casting for all Firebase metadata fields

### New Features Added

- Newsletter versioning system (complete infrastructure)
- Version history components and services
- Enhanced Firebase metadata with originalFileInfo
- Surgical Firebase-only refresh functionality

## üéØ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Critical Issues to Address

1. **Fix sync functionality**: Ensure drafts properly appear in main list after sync
2. **Debug data flow**: Trace why synced items don't show up immediately
3. **Test sync workflows**: Comprehensive testing of individual and bulk sync
4. **UI state management**: Ensure proper reactivity after sync operations

### Enhancement Opportunities

1. Complete versioning system integration
2. Enhanced error handling and user feedback
3. Performance monitoring and optimization
4. User experience improvements
