## üéØ INTEGRATION WORKFLOW

### **Template Discovery & Display**
1. **Page Load**: `SubmitContentPage.vue` loads and calls `loadCanvaTemplates()`
2. **Template Fetching**: System queries Firestore `app/config` document for `canvaTemplates` array
3. **Active Filtering**: Only templates with `isActive !== false` are displayed
4. **Dynamic Banner**: Banner appears if templates are available and user hasn't submitted content

### **User Interaction Flow**
1. **Template Awareness**: User sees Canva integration banner with template availability
2. **Feature Learning**: User clicks "Learn More" to open comprehensive showcase dialog
3. **Template Preview**: Dialog shows up to 4 template previews with descriptions
4. **Workflow Understanding**: User learns about automatic field mapping and design benefits
5. **Form Integration**: User proceeds to content submission form with template selection

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Reactive State**: `availableTemplates` and `hasCanvaTemplates` provide real-time UI updates
- **Error Resilience**: Template loading errors are logged but don't interrupt user experience
- **Performance**: Template loading happens asynchronously during page initialization
- **Accessibility**: All interactive elements include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
