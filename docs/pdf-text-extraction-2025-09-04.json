LIKE US ON FACEBOOK! www.facebook.com conashaughlakes Vandal Mystery Solved! When the snow finally melted in April, we began receiving calls from homeowners on the lake. There was a concern regarding what appeared to be vandalism to trees in that area. An inspection of the trees revealed at least one very busy beaver was at work over the winter cutting down trees for its lodge. Some of the trees were damaged as high as three feet from the ground and it was figured that the depth of the snow this winter allowed Mr. Beaver to reach new heights. From the appearance of the tree in this photo he must have some strong teeth and a good dentist. The Summer Issue of the Conashaugh Courier is our prelude to the Communitys Annual Meeting. It includes information regarding the 201415 proposed budget and a copy of the CLCA reserve schedule along with minutes from last years Annual Meeting. There are also editorials and articles for your information. This years meeting is scheduled to take place Saturday September 27, 2014 at the Parish Hall at St. Vincents Church just south of Conashaugh S AVE T h E D ATE! Annual Meeting Saturday Set For September 27, 2014 Lakes Community. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. All members will receive their Annual Meeting packet in August.

CLC ASSOCIATION Presidents Message I would like to begin by acknowledging and thanking outgoing Board Members, Larry Farnum, Mike Stevenson and Neil Johnson. Each of them are at their end of a well served six year term. Thank you also to former Board Member Paul Kelleher whose resignation was tendered in June for personal reasons. Director Reggie Iglesias assumed the role of Recreation Liaison upon Pauls departure and hit the ground running by also volunteering to chair the Annual Community Picnic. There are many things we would like to do but we the Board do not want to put the burden of the expenses associated with them on our members in the form of higher annual dues. Safety and the enforcement of rules are important to us. We are confident that our current rules are reasonable while at the same time not adversely impacting or imposing upon the comfort or rights of those who live here. There always seems that something new is coming down the pike in this business. This past January we along with other dam owners in the area were informed by the Department of Environmental Protection that beginning July 1st there would be an annual fee imposed for owning a dam. Failure to pay the fee came with a threat from the DEP of an order to drain our lake. Fortunately, with our dam being a non-hazard, category 2 dam, the fee was 800.00 which is nominal compared to some of the neighboring communities with multiple andor high hazard dams. There are other interesting fees that the DEP would like to impose on our communities relating to dams. This is a concern to me and should be to you as well. I along with other community leaders in the area wrote multiple letters to agencies ranging from local township and county supervisors to legislators to everyone in between regarding the impact these fees are causing to our communities and asking for intervention. As of this writing only one elected official, Senator Lisa Baker responded. The payment of dues is of utmost importance for the continuous operation of any Community. Thankfully a majority of our members are diligent with this responsibility. Non-payment of dues will only result in placing your account in collections and finally judgment and a lien on your property. It is not something that we like to do but, if you ignore requests for payment and have no contact with the office you leave us no choice. News released in February by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show volunteering in the nation is at a ten year low. Volunteers have been scarce here also. With parents working more and the demands of family life when you return home from work, sports and school, it is no wonder about statistics. Most of our committees have trickled to small down to zero participation. We are thankful for whatever contributions are made, large or small. The CLCA Board of Directors works cohesively and strives to hold down dues costs while at the same time maintaining the stated requirements set forth in ACT 180. The Board throughout the month prepares for the monthly meetings to accomplish the tasks as approved by the Board. 20132014 brought with it a harsh winter, a tougher economy and increased pricing. The Finance Committee and Board worked very hard on the budget before you this September for a vote. On that note I am asking that our members join me in approving the proposed budget for the 20142015 fiscal year. If you have any questions about the proposed budget, please contact the CLCA Office staff and they can direct you to my office if needed.. Thank you, John Crerand, CLCA President CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2014 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Security Reports COLONEL MANUEL SCHONHORN JAN 04-10, 2014: Car in snow bank; truck off road; car off road; broken gate.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2014 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION The last time I wrote we were up to our eyebrows in snow. As I write this now it is a balmy 90 degrees and summer is half way through. It was a busy winter and a very late arriving spring. The following are developments since the last report: Properties: There are 563 Homes, 275 Lots and 28 contiguous lots. As of this writing, there are four foreclosed properties that have transferred back to the mortgage holders. By the time you are reading this, those homes will likely be sold. Foreclosure properties once transferred back to the mortgage companies are selling very quickly. There hasnt been any new tax sale activity since the last report. As of July 23, 2014 the Wayne Pike Realtor MLS site showed sixty properties for sale in the Community. In that mix are homes and undeveloped properties. Roads There will be major road repair occurring on Conashaugh Trail early this fall. The road was originally scoped last year however, funds were not enough to complete the repair. A majority of this road will be repaved. One culvert pipe was removed in the vicinity of Sandy Pine Trail and at least four others will be removed. Additional information regarding paving will be posted on the LOOP and CLCAs Facebook page as I receive it. Security In early July the patrol division of Vector Security was purchased by United American Security. The purchase did not affect our existing contract. Officers working at this site for Vector maintained their positions. Officer Sara Gabell was promoted to site Sergeant. We are happy to have her here at our Community. She has been doing an excellent job. Due to a period of mischief and vandalism in the community, a security initiative was taken to monitor guests entering the Community. Volunteers worked on Friday and Saturday nights from 9 p.m. until midnight signing in guests. We would like to continue these random security checks but are in need of additional volunteers. If you are able to help please call the office. Thank you to John Crerand, Joe Lalor, Patti Havekost, From The Office J EANNE C ALABRESE Rick Hordyszynski and Mike Stevenson who joined me volunteering in this project. Illuminated Sign The housing for the sign at the mailbox parking lot was constructed by our Maintenance crew. A special thanks to Dave in Maintenance who personally milled a lot of the finish pieces on the sign. It came out fantastic and there has been positive feedback. Trees All members must obtain permits before removing any tree greater than 1 diameter. Inspections will be completed by Maintenance before a permit is issued. Please allow seven days for the inspection to be completed. Removal of trees without a permit is a violation subject to a fine. Trash We recently renewed our contract with Waste Management. Pricing for trash will remain the same with a slight 20.00 per month increase for recycling charges. As a reminder, the compactor is for household trash. This does not include building materials, wall to wall carpeting, large appliances, yard equipment or yard wasteleaves, branches, wood, rocks. We are charged by the weight of the compactor bins. Can you imagine our trash costs if everyone threw their leaves in the compactor? Please rake leaves into your woods or have them removed by a landscaper. Recycling Waste Management began a two pick up per week schedule in July and will continue through the end of September. Unfortunately people occasionally still use the recycle bins to dump household trash or unwanted items. Do not do it. The area is under surveillance. People have been caught and fined. And by placing your unwanted items with a FREE sign does not earn you a get out of jail card. Same goes for dumping at the compactor. If you have something to give away, put it on the LOOP or Facebook. And as a reminder:  Our recycling program is single stream. You do not have to separate your items. Glass, paper, aluminum, junk mail, newspapers, cardboard and most plastics are recyclable. Our hauler currently does not have a program to recycle plastic bags.  Do not place plastic bags in the recycle bins. If you transport recyclables in bags, please deposit the empty bag in the marked receptacle located next to the bins. There is one exception for placing bags in the recycle bins and that applies to bags containing paper from shredding machines. Spring Dumpster Day A total of 4 thirty yard dumpsters were used to collect items. 3 dumpsters were used during the event held on May 17th, one of which was for collecting metal. A fourth dumpster was called in for additional items that could not fit in the 2 collection bins. A total of 14.83 tons of trash and fees totaling 2343.00 were collected. For a comparison Fall 2013 Dumpster Day a total of 9.05 tons of trash was collected Total charges by County Waste was 1143.75. There will be a fall dumpster day announced shortly. Please use these opportunities to clean up around your properties and dispose of larger items not appropriate for the compactor. Road Clean Ups Dont worry, the maid will get it. Thats what runs through my head when I pick up trash along the road when I walk the in my neighborhood. On that note I know that I am not alone in my efforts and want to take a moment to thank the following people who have also voluntarily cleaned up our roads; Bobby and Barbara Keller, Elizabeth Herman and family, Annette and Josh Musano. Thanks for caring and doing. Thank you also to anyone else who picks up in their neighborhood. Dogs Dogs at large continue to be a problem. The dog warden has been in the Community and hefty fines administered. Unfortunately some are using the ball field to walk dogs and not picking up after them. Children play there and maintenance has to cut and weed whack the area. It is pretty unpleasant when you bring back a tractor with its wheels full of poop or hit one of those loads with a weed whacker. Have some consideration and do the right thing. USDOT As previously reported CLCA participates in random drug and alcohol testing. In February we received a report from the lab that performs lab testing of urine specimens s for the period between July and December 2013 during which time one pre- employment and four random tests were performed. All five specimens reported negative results Dam News Beginning July 1 of this year we were required to pay Annual Fees to the DEP for owning a dam. Pennoni Associates conducted our annual dam inspection in early July and we are awaiting the results of that inspection. New Well A new well was drilled for Conashaugh in July. The well will service the Rec Building, Pool and Maintenance yard. The well that previously serviced these areas is still intact as it is servicing two homes on the lake. Lightning Strikes....Again Our member only entrance gate was struck twice by lightning over the 4th of July weekend both times taking out the card reader and the second time a dvr. We are not the only victims of these strikes. Other communities have had similar problems. Fortunately there are now surge arrestors on that gate and while nothing is guaranteed to stop lightning damage, they have certainly helped to keep damages to a minimum. Facebook Page A number of other Communities shudder at the thought of having a Facebook Page. I am happy to report that ours has been up and running for several years with very little incident. Just a note about the page. It is there to share CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2014 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION information about our Community. It is not there to tear down the Community with negative comments andor personal opinions misconceptions about the operations, employees, projects or your neighbors. If you have a concern, comment or question pick up the phone or visit the office. Y ou can also send a personal message via the Facebook page or an email to clcaloopptd.net. Dues All payment plans need to be paid in full by August 28th. Our new fiscal year begins October 1st. Outstanding accounts will be sent to collections before the end of September. Please be advised that once an account is placed in collections, it will not be recalled. Current accounts with collections without successful recoveries will be reviewed and recalled for judgment at the Magisterial Court. Likewise once suit is filed it will not be withdrawn until all payments are satisfied. Know Where Your Kids Are There have been reports of break ins on some foreclosed or developing property homes. Please have some dialogue with your kids about the dangers and consequences of doing this. These homes are all owned by someone or a bank. Entering the homes is trespassing and a punishable crime. They are not club houses! Some owners have requested checks by security. If you wish to have a home check please contact the Security Office at 570-686-1130. www.tashlik.com 1 570-828-2306 800-634-5964 1506 Route 739 stashlikptd.net Serving Milford Dingmans Ferry and Pike County Pennsylvani a Sold Sold Sold Sold MAKE TASHLIK A HOUSE WORD CALL FOR A FREE MARKET ANALYSIS Sold WANTED REAL ESTATE SALESPERSON CALL STAN TASHLIK 570-828-2306 CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2014 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION Congratulations!

During the past year Ive worked closely with Office personnel and members of the Finance Committee reviewing income and expenditures for the Community. This year has been challenging. Record winter temperatures and snow had a large impact on our Maintenance lines along with continued foreclosures on properties and the overall increased costs of doing business. The good news is that with only a couple of months left in the fiscal year and despite the hurdles, we are in good financial shape and dont anticipate any surprises to change that direction through the end of September. Income has been sufficient to fund both the Roads and General Reserve Accounts as planned for in the current years budget. Efforts by CLCA Office staff and Sunrise Credit Services, our collection agency, have resulted in the recovery of old dues which has helped offset current uncollected funds. Old dues are monies that were due prior to, but not collected, before the current fiscal year started. Recognizing old dues as income while still considering doubtful accounts was one of a couple of different approaches I used for preparing the proposed budget. I also compared last years actual expenses and the expenses through eight months of the current fiscal year and moved numbers within the budget lines to arrive at a proposed increase of 1.0 which translates 11.40 more than last years CLC ASSOCIATION Budget Talk With The Treasurer BY F REDERIC k kLINE budget for the year or.95 cents per month. Our biggest single expense this year as in the past several years will be road work. As of this writing, a majority of Conashaugh Trail is slated to be repaved. It is one of three major roadways in the community and with that comes much wear and tear. This road came up as a recommended paving project last fall, however a collapsing section of Overbrook Run, another major roadway, and a number of smaller deteriorating roads were a priority. A number of folks have posed the question why do we repave roads that are already paved instead of paving the remaining unpaved roads. It is very important to keep our main roads maintained as best as possible and address any potential problems before they turn into greater problems. When funds allow additional new paving is considered. A majority if not all of the money used for these projects is from CLCAs Road Reserves. One new expense being imposed on communities are fees by the Department of Environmental Protection. In anticipation of current and perpetually anticipated fees from this agency, a line has been added to the CLCA Reserve Schedule. Please see comments in the Presidents column regarding these new charges and how they are impacting communities in our area. In closing I ask that you join the Board and myself in approving the 201415 proposed budget. I am satisfied that it is a fair budget and one that will allow for us to operate for another year. If you have any questions regarding the budget, please contact the office. 20142015 Board Meetings All meetings are held on the second Saturday of each month and begin at 10:30 a.m. in the Recreation Building.

Thank you for your cooperation. Trash Revisited BY ANNETTE MUSANO Several years ago I wrote an article for the Courier entitled Trash Begets Trash. In its contents I cited the duration of time it takes for various trash items to decomposebiodegrade. At this time I have no intentions of repeating any of that information other than to remind my readers that aluminum foil, plastic bottles and Styrofoam cups are not biodegradable. It is quite obvious to me that many of the litter offenders out there either didnt read my article or just dont give a darn as this continues to be a significant problem along the various roads and common areas of Conashaugh. I want to say that despite the fact that my son and I are growing somewhat weary, the constant new supply of trash will not deter us from our mission of trying to keep the roads litter free. It does, however, continue to boggle my mind that the littering somehow defiles the laws of physics in this Community. How else can you explain the mere fact that a person can walk along the road carrying a container full of liquid but once the product is consumed, the empty and obviously lighter weight receptacle can no longer be held on to and must but tossed on the road as if it is too heavy to carry. As I see it, it all comes down to one simple word - RESPECT; respect for the earth, respect for the environment, respect for your Community, respect for your friends and neighbors, respect for yourself. In the immortal words of Forrest Gump, Thats all I have to say about that.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2014 PAGE 14 OUTDOOR  RECREATION GARDENING 101 Ideas for establishing a garden or making the one you currently have more beautiful begin one step at a time. The following jobs during the gardening season can lead to a garden that is easier and more satisfying for the current as well as the next growing season. Feed the Soil. Start with great soil and youll wind up with great plants. Healthy plants get less diseases, attract less insect pests and require less water. Plus you wont have to remember to fertilizer every other week. Start with a good analysis of your existing soil. You can have all the essential nutrients tested or just test the pH. Many nurseries provide this service as well as your local Cooperative Extension Service. If your soil is deficient in any minerals or nutrients, amend the soil according to recommendations. Slow release, organic fertilizers can help supplement deficient nutrients. Then keep adding organic matter, like compost, regularly. Time Released Fertilizer and Water Polymers. Its not practical to use compost or garden soil in containers and so some supplemental feeding is necessary to keep the plants going. Containers also dry out more quickly than garden bed soil, especially if the bed is mulched. So start your container gardening season by adding some slow release fertilizer pellets and some polymer crystals that grab, hold and slowly release water to the plant roots. Add both at planting time. These products are widely available at garden centers. Water as Efficiently as You Can. Water is a precious resource and no gardener can afford to waste it. You can capture water in rain barrels and route to garden beds using perforated soaker hoses. Mulch. Many gardeners only view mulch as decoration. Mulch does make a garden look more attractive, but it also keeps the soil and plant roots cool, retains moisture so you can water less often, prevents weed seeds from seeing the light of day and sprouting and feeds the soil. Right there youve cut down on watering, weeding and fertilizing time. Weeds. A completely weed-free garden is almost impossible to achieve. One approach is to limit their numbers with vigilance rather than try to eradicate them with extreme measures. By making weed prevention part of a weekly gardening routine, the task becomes less daunting over time. Pesticides. When it comes to pest control, start by identifying the enemy. Once you know the pest youre fighting you can choose the best strategy. Soft-bodied insects like mites, aphids and immature mealybugs can be treated with a spray of 1 to 2 tablespoons of dish soap added to 1 gallon of water. Choose Lower Maintenance Perennials. Make the backbone of your garden perennial flowers that can take care of themselves. Plants like Astilbes and Sedums, that look good all season and dont need deadheading, pinching or staking. Here are even more low maintenance perennials: Black-Eyed Susans, Bleeding Hearts, Boxwood, Lavender, Peonies, Russian Sage and Spirea. Well, there you have it. You can add plenty of beautiful landscape plants to your yard without a lot of work. Happy Gardening from the Ladybug.

There was a concern regarding what appeared to be vandalism to trees in that area. An inspection of the trees revealed at least one very busy beaver was at work over the winter cutting down trees for its lodge. Some of the trees were damaged as high as three feet from the ground and it was figured that the depth of the snow this winter allowed Mr. Beaver to reach new heights. From the appearance of the tree in this photo he must have some strong teeth and a good dentist. The Summer Issue of the Conashaugh Courier is our prelude to the Communitys Annual Meeting.

CLC ASSOCIATION Presidents Message I would like to begin by acknowledging and thanking outgoing Board Members, Larry Farnum, Mike Stevenson and Neil Johnson. Each of them are at their end of a well served six year term. Thank you also to former Board Member Paul Kelleher whose resignation was tendered in June for personal reasons. Director Reggie Iglesias assumed the role of Recreation Liaison upon Pauls departure and hit the ground running by also volunteering to chair the Annual Community Picnic. There are many things we would like to do but we the Board do not want to put the burden of the expenses associated with them on our members in the form of higher annual dues. Safety and the enforcement of rules are important to us. We are confident that our current rules are reasonable while at the same time not adversely impacting or imposing upon the comfort or rights of those who live here. There always seems that something new is coming down the pike in this business. This past January we along with other dam owners in the area were informed by the Department of Environmental Protection that beginning July 1st there would be an annual fee imposed for owning a dam. Failure to pay the fee came with a threat from the DEP of an order to drain our lake. Fortunately, with our dam being a non-hazard, category 2 dam, the fee was 800.00 which is nominal compared to some of the neighboring communities with multiple andor high hazard dams. There are other interesting fees that the DEP would like to impose on our communities relating to dams. This is a concern to me and should be to you as well. I along with other community leaders in the area wrote multiple letters to agencies ranging from local township and county supervisors to legislators to everyone in between regarding the impact these fees are causing to our communities and asking for intervention. As of this writing only one elected official, Senator Lisa Baker responded. The payment of dues is of utmost importance for the continuous operation of any Community. Thankfully a majority of our members are diligent with this responsibility. Non-payment of dues will only result in placing your account in collections and finally judgment and a lien on your property. It is not something that we like to do but, if you ignore requests for payment and have no contact with the office you leave us no choice. News released in February by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show volunteering in the nation is at a ten year low. Volunteers have been scarce here also. With parents working more and the demands of family life when you return home from work, sports and school, it is no wonder about statistics. Most of our committees have trickled to small down to zero participation. We are thankful for whatever contributions are made, large or small. The CLCA Board of Directors works cohesively and strives to hold down dues costs while at the same time maintaining the stated requirements set forth in ACT 180. The Board throughout the month prepares for the monthly meetings to accomplish the tasks as approved by the Board. 20132014 brought with it a harsh winter, a tougher economy and increased pricing. The Finance Committee and Board worked very hard on the budget before you this September for a vote. On that note I am asking that our members join me in approving the proposed budget for the 20142015 fiscal year. If you have any questions about the proposed budget, please contact the CLCA Office staff and they can direct you to my office if needed.. Thank you, John Crerand, CLCA President",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2014 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION The last time I wrote we were up to our eyebrows in snow. As I write this now it is a balmy 90 degrees and summer is half way through. It was a busy winter and a very late arriving spring. The following are developments since the last report: Properties: There are 563 Homes, 275 Lots and 28 contiguous lots. As of this writing, there are four foreclosed properties that have transferred back to the mortgage holders. By the time you are reading this, those homes will likely be sold. Foreclosure properties once transferred back to the mortgage companies are selling very quickly. There hasnt been any new tax sale activity since the last report. As of July 23, 2014 the Wayne Pike Realtor MLS site showed sixty properties for sale in the Community. In that mix are homes and undeveloped properties. Roads There will be major road repair occurring on Conashaugh Trail early this fall. The road was originally scoped last year however, funds were not enough to complete the repair. A majority of this road will be repaved. One culvert pipe was removed in the vicinity of Sandy Pine Trail and at least four others will be removed. Additional information regarding paving will be posted on the LOOP and CLCAs Facebook page as I receive it. Security In early July the patrol division of Vector Security was purchased by United American Security. The purchase did not affect our existing contract. Officers working at this site for Vector maintained their positions. Officer Sara Gabell was promoted to site Sergeant. We are happy to have her here at our Community. She has been doing an excellent job. Due to a period of mischief and vandalism in the community, a security initiative was taken to monitor guests entering the Community. Volunteers worked on Friday and Saturday nights from 9 p.m. until midnight signing in guests. We would like to continue these random security checks but are in need of additional volunteers. If you are able to help please call the office. Thank you to John Crerand, Joe Lalor, Patti Havekost, From The Office J EANNE C ALABRESE Rick Hordyszynski and Mike Stevenson who joined me volunteering in this project. Illuminated Sign The housing for the sign at the mailbox parking lot was constructed by our Maintenance crew. A special thanks to Dave in Maintenance who personally milled a lot of the finish pieces on the sign. It came out fantastic and there has been positive feedback. Trees All members must obtain permits before removing any tree greater than 1 diameter. Inspections will be completed by Maintenance before a permit is issued. Please allow seven days for the inspection to be completed. Removal of trees without a permit is a violation subject to a fine. Trash We recently renewed our contract with Waste Management. Pricing for trash will remain the same with a slight 20.00 per month increase for recycling charges. As a reminder, the compactor is for household trash. This does not include building materials, wall to wall carpeting, large appliances, yard equipment or yard wasteleaves, branches, wood, rocks. We are charged by the weight of the compactor bins. Can you imagine our trash costs if everyone threw their leaves in the compactor? Please rake leaves into your woods or have them removed by a landscaper. Recycling Waste Management began a two pick up per week schedule in July and will continue through the end of September. Unfortunately people occasionally still use the recycle bins to dump household trash or unwanted items. Do not do it. The area is under surveillance. People have been caught and fined. And by placing your unwanted items with a FREE sign does not earn you a get out of jail card. Same goes for dumping at the compactor. If you have something to give away, put it on the LOOP or Facebook. And as a reminder:  Our recycling program is single stream. You do not have to separate your items. Glass, paper, aluminum, junk mail, newspapers, cardboard and most plastics are recyclable. Our hauler currently does not have a program to recycle plastic bags.  Do not place plastic bags in the recycle bins. If you transport recyclables in bags, please deposit the empty bag in the marked receptacle located next to the bins. There is one exception for placing bags in the recycle bins and that applies to bags containing paper from shredding machines. Spring Dumpster Day A total of 4 thirty yard dumpsters were used to collect items. 3 dumpsters were used during the event held on May 17th, one of which was for collecting metal. A fourth dumpster was called in for additional items that could not fit in the 2 collection bins. A total of 14.83 tons of trash and fees totaling 2343.00 were collected. For a comparison Fall 2013 Dumpster Day a total of 9.05 tons of trash was collected Total charges by County Waste was 1143.75. There will be a fall dumpster day announced shortly. Please use these opportunities to clean up around your properties and dispose of larger items not appropriate for the compactor. Road Clean Ups Dont worry, the maid will get it. Thats what runs through my head when I pick up trash along the road when I walk the in my neighborhood. On that note I know that I am not alone in my efforts and want to take a moment to thank the following people who have also voluntarily cleaned up our roads; Bobby and Barbara Keller, Elizabeth Herman and family, Annette and Josh Musano. Thanks for caring and doing. Thank you also to anyone else who picks up in their neighborhood. Dogs Dogs at large continue to be a problem. The dog warden has been in the Community and hefty fines administered. Unfortunately some are using the ball field to walk dogs and not picking up after them. Children play there and maintenance has to cut and weed whack the area. It is pretty unpleasant when you bring back a tractor with its wheels full of poop or hit one of those loads with a weed whacker. Have some consideration and do the right thing. USDOT As previously reported CLCA participates in random drug and alcohol testing. In February we received a report from the lab that performs lab testing of urine specimens s for the period between July and December 2013 during which time one pre- employment and four random tests were performed. All five specimens reported negative results Dam News Beginning July 1 of this year we were required to pay Annual Fees to the DEP for owning a dam. Pennoni Associates conducted our annual dam inspection in early July and we are awaiting the results of that inspection. New Well A new well was drilled for Conashaugh in July. The well will service the Rec Building, Pool and Maintenance yard. The well that previously serviced these areas is still intact as it is servicing two homes on the lake. Lightning Strikes....Again Our member only entrance gate was struck twice by lightning over the 4th of July weekend both times taking out the card reader and the second time a dvr. We are not the only victims of these strikes. Other communities have had similar problems. Fortunately there are now surge arrestors on that gate and while nothing is guaranteed to stop lightning damage, they have certainly helped to keep damages to a minimum. Facebook Page A number of other Communities shudder at the thought of having a Facebook Page. I am happy to report that ours has been up and running for several years with very little incident. Just a note about the page. It is there to share",

During the past year Ive worked closely with Office personnel and members of the Finance Committee reviewing income and expenditures for the Community. This year has been challenging. Record winter temperatures and snow had a large impact on our Maintenance lines along with continued foreclosures on properties and the overall increased costs of doing business. The good news is that with only a couple of months left in the fiscal year and despite the hurdles, we are in good financial shape and dont anticipate any surprises to change that direction through the end of September. Income has been sufficient to fund both the Roads and General Reserve Accounts as planned for in the current years budget. Efforts by CLCA Office staff and Sunrise Credit Services, our collection agency, have resulted in the recovery of old dues which has helped offset current uncollected funds. Old dues are monies that were due prior to, but not collected, before the current fiscal year started. Recognizing old dues as income while still considering doubtful accounts was one of a couple of different approaches I used for preparing the proposed budget. I also compared last years actual expenses and the expenses through eight months of the current fiscal year and moved numbers within the budget lines to arrive at a proposed increase of 1.0 which translates 11.40 more than last years CLC ASSOCIATION Budget Talk With The Treasurer BY F REDERIC k kLINE budget for the year or.95 cents per month. Our biggest single expense this year as in the past several years will be road work. As of this writing, a majority of Conashaugh Trail is slated to be repaved. It is one of three major roadways in the community and with that comes much wear and tear. This road came up as a recommended paving project last fall, however a collapsing section of Overbrook Run, another major roadway, and a number of smaller deteriorating roads were a priority. A number of folks have posed the question why do we repave roads that are already paved instead of paving the remaining unpaved roads. It is very important to keep our main roads maintained as best as possible and address any potential problems before they turn into greater problems. When funds allow additional new paving is considered. A majority if not all of the money used for these projects is from CLCAs Road Reserves. One new expense being imposed on communities are fees by the Department of Environmental Protection. In anticipation of current and perpetually anticipated fees from this agency, a line has been added to the CLCA Reserve Schedule. Please see comments in the Presidents column regarding these new charges and how they are impacting communities in our area. In closing I ask that you join the Board and myself in approving the 201415 proposed budget. I am satisfied that it is a fair budget and one that will allow for us to operate for another year. If you have any questions regarding the budget, please contact the office. 20142015 Board Meetings All meetings are held on the second Saturday of each month and begin at 10:30 a.m. in the Recreation Building.

Her physical therapy will also be undertaken there. We have tried to acclimate our Tigercat to our NYC apartment, but he was miserable. He cried all day and night, lingering at the apts door. He needs and deserves a loving home. He is 14 years old, male, altered, and in good health. He likes to be out at night, chasing chipmunks and mice. He roams close to home. He sleeps much of the day. He has been content to rest in the sunroom, watching the animals feed on the deck outside the glass door. He needs a home without other animals. He likes to doze next to a warm body on a couch. He slept with me during the winter months. He has been a lovely pet. If someone cannot take him, maybe he can be fostered until we return.

Thank you for your cooperation. Trash Revisited BY ANNETTE MUSANO Several years ago I wrote an article for the Courier entitled Trash Begets Trash. In its contents I cited the duration of time it takes for various trash items to decomposebiodegrade. At this time I have no intentions of repeating any of that information other than to remind my readers that aluminum foil, plastic bottles and Styrofoam cups are not biodegradable. It is quite obvious to me that many of the litter offenders out there either didnt read my article or just dont give a darn as this continues to be a significant problem along the various roads and common areas of Conashaugh. I want to say that despite the fact that my son and I are growing somewhat weary, the constant new supply of trash will not deter us from our mission of trying to keep the roads litter free. It does, however, continue to boggle my mind that the littering somehow defiles the laws of physics in this Community. How else can you explain the mere fact that a person can walk along the road carrying a container full of liquid but once the product is consumed, the empty and obviously lighter weight receptacle can no longer be held on to and must but tossed on the road as if it is too heavy to carry. As I see it, it all comes down to one simple word - RESPECT; respect for the earth, respect for the environment, respect for your Community, respect for your friends and neighbors, respect for yourself. In the immortal words of Forrest Gump, Thats all I have to say about that.",

A proxy is a written authorization empowering another to vote or act for the signer. CLCA recognizes proxies at the Annual Meeting.

If additional voting is needed during the meeting and you are not present to vote or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed-in vote. Situations where additional voting may be required at a meeting includes a failed or tied budget. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding matters such as the budget and candidates. The proxy designated by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mail- in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2014 PAGE 14 OUTDOOR  RECREATION GARDENING 101 Ideas for establishing a garden or making the one you currently have more beautiful begin one step at a time. The following jobs during the gardening season can lead to a garden that is easier and more satisfying for the current as well as the next growing season. Feed the Soil. Start with great soil and youll wind up with great plants. Healthy plants get less diseases, attract less insect pests and require less water. Plus you wont have to remember to fertilizer every other week. Start with a good analysis of your existing soil. You can have all the essential nutrients tested or just test the pH. Many nurseries provide this service as well as your local Cooperative Extension Service. If your soil is deficient in any minerals or nutrients, amend the soil according to recommendations. Slow release, organic fertilizers can help supplement deficient nutrients. Then keep adding organic matter, like compost, regularly. Time Released Fertilizer and Water Polymers. Its not practical to use compost or garden soil in containers and so some supplemental feeding is necessary to keep the plants going. Containers also dry out more quickly than garden bed soil, especially if the bed is mulched. So start your container gardening season by adding some slow release fertilizer pellets and some polymer crystals that grab, hold and slowly release water to the plant roots. Add both at planting time. These products are widely available at garden centers. Water as Efficiently as You Can. Water is a precious resource and no gardener can afford to waste it. You can capture water in rain barrels and route to garden beds using perforated soaker hoses. Mulch. Many gardeners only view mulch as decoration. Mulch does make a garden look more attractive, but it also keeps the soil and plant roots cool, retains moisture so you can water less often, prevents weed seeds from seeing the light of day and sprouting and feeds the soil. Right there youve cut down on watering, weeding and fertilizing time. Weeds. A completely weed-free garden is almost impossible to achieve. One approach is to limit their numbers with vigilance rather than try to eradicate them with extreme measures. By making weed prevention part of a weekly gardening routine, the task becomes less daunting over time. Pesticides. When it comes to pest control, start by identifying the enemy. Once you know the pest youre fighting you can choose the best strategy. Soft-bodied insects like mites, aphids and immature mealybugs can be treated with a spray of 1 to 2 tablespoons of dish soap added to 1 gallon of water. Choose Lower Maintenance Perennials. Make the backbone of your garden perennial flowers that can take care of themselves. Plants like Astilbes and Sedums, that look good all season and dont need deadheading, pinching or staking. Here are even more low maintenance perennials: Black-Eyed Susans, Bleeding Hearts, Boxwood, Lavender, Peonies, Russian Sage and Spirea. Well, there you have it. You can add plenty of beautiful landscape plants to your yard without a lot of work. Happy Gardening from the Ladybug.",

By Bob Weed Conashaugh Lakes is consistently ranked as one of the best private Communities in NEPA. We all know this is the result of several factors, but perhaps the most important is the time, energy and devotion given by Community Members to the several Committees which help all Community Members communicate with the Board of Directors. In turn, the Board acts on what is has been informed is necessary to the continued well-being of the Community. I speak for myself here as Liaison to the Rules and Regulations Committee, but I know what I say is equally true of the other Committees. There has been no interest in attending the Rules and Regs meetings for months held, you may note, every third Tuesday evening at 7 PM at the Rec Building. The reason, I believe, is obvious: All is Well in every aspect of the maintaining of the Communitys interest, concerns and welfare. We have, apparently, achieved a level of excellence and efficiency at which all are quite comfortable; not only comfortable, but complacent; not only complacent, but convinced that All is Well. And when an entire Community is convinced, Utopia is upon us. Now there are those would argue the reverse; that all is so unwell that all the members have lost hope, faith and dedication to the Promise that was Conashaugh Lakes. Couple those with individuals who prefer to suffer in silence and you have the very beginning of the crumbling of the Promise, of the slow decay of that Promise, the final withering of that Promise. How is it with you, Well or Unwell? A Plea from y our Neighbor By Jeanne Calabrese When asked for suggestions for an article for this issue of the Conashaugh Courier, it was requested by one of your neighbors that an article be written reminding residents to PLEASE drive within the speed limits. It doesnt matter where this neighbor lives. They may live next door, down the block or on the road that you speed down on your way to the mailbox, bus stop, shopping, work pick one or perhaps they live on the intersection where you run that stop sign because no one is there. Unfortunately, despite repeated reminders written in past articles, on Facebook postings and via the LOOP, there are some who just dont get it and continue to do their own thing and disregard the hazards they place upon their neighbors, themselves and their own children. Since the summer there has been an increase of members reporting others for traffic violations including but not limited to speeding, illegal passing, reckless driving, running stop signs and tailgating through the entrance gates. Some have even filed formal complaints resulting in violations with fines being issued. And yes, that can happen and it has. Of course just as with any other violation that may be issued, the recipient has the right to due process a hearing. Please slow down, please. Your neighbor has asked that you include in your resolutions for 2014 a promise to drive safely because the heartache you save may be your own.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2014 PAGE 6 When he discovered that Apples App Store lacked what he was looking for, Mr. Douglas Merritt, current resident and Physics teacher at Mountain Lakes HS in NJ, decided to take things into his own hands. He designed his own apps! It took a lot of research and experimentation, but he is of course a science teacher. As of now, Mr. Merritt has four apps available for purchase in the App Store. He has also created a website for his app designs, called The Fizix Group. It all began a few years ago with linearization. To replace the hassle of laptops for the whole class, Mr. Merritt wanted a program that could automatically linearize the experimental data his students collected and be accessed from smartphones. He was fairly certain that someone would have invented one already. But he found nothing. Ive been using Apple products since 1988, Mr. Merritt says. So why not design his own Apple-facilitated program? He flipped through the Xcode tutorials included with his Apple products and learned that it cost nearly one hundred dollars to join Apples development team. I was thinking, thats kind of a lot of money to spend on something Im not sure Ill really use. Would it be worth it? he wondered. According to Mr. Merritt, two common practice apps for beginners are calculators and quadratic function solvers. With this in mind, he chose the quadratic solver to learn programming before he would tackle the linearization app. He displays the un-updated version, explaining what features were missing from the original program. This was what it used to be, but when Id show it to people, theyd say, Wow, thats so cool, but what if it did this, too? People were suggesting things left and right! Mr. Merritt says. Now, the version in the App Store not only solves the quadratic equation, but displays the answer in radical form, lists pertinent values such as the discriminant, graphs the function, enables zoom and scroll, and displays the coordinates of Need Help Solving The Quadratic Equation? By Maddy DiGiovanni points when they are tapped. A very useful tool if you are enrolled in a class such as pre-Calc, Trigonometry, or Physics. Another of his apps is a temperature converter. After perusing several CelsiusFahrenheit converters already published in the App Store, Mr. Merritt noticed that none of them included the Kelvin scale. How lame is that?! he exclaims, an incredulous look on his face. Naturally, he wrote a program including Kelvin. His engineering professor friend, however, was still unsatisfied. I showed it to him, Mr. Merritt recalls, and he said, You forgot Rankines! and I was thinking, What on earth is a Rankine After learning that the Rankine scale is a temperature measurement system commonly used by engineers, he edited his program to include that as well. Moreover, instead of purchasing a sound file for number-pad sounds, he simply recorded himself clicking a pen and programmed that in, too. If you ever use his Cool Converter, you will know that the sound effects are genuinely Mr. Merritts. Mr. Merritt also has two other apps on the app store. One is an app specifically for his seniors. Called RUExempt it helps his seniors calculate if they are exempt from finals, one of the last senior privileges of the year. The other is a social media app for a friend that is in the stamping business. Titled Pooler, this app gives access to a very talented stamper named Catherine Pooler. It has her blog, where you can post messages, Facebook feed, and twitter feed. Now, Mr. Merritt is returning to the idea that started it all. He hopes to begin work on the linearization app soon. In the meantime, be sure to check out his four current publications in the App Store; The Blue Quadratic Solver, Cool Converter, RUExempt, and Pooler. Just go to the store and type in any of the titles. Hope this helps with your homework! CLC ASSOCIATION CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2014 PAGE 7 Heads Up! Road Ban Ahead! By Jeanne Calabrese With winter past the halfway mark, it is time to remind everyone that road bans are imminent. This may be old news to some of our members. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVWgross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid February into March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non- emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation. Got Stuff? Dont forget to send your CLCA non-commercial Classifieds to clcaloopptd.net.

I think. Weve had our share of snow and ice this winter. As I am writing this, the temperature for the second round so far this season is in the negative digits. Its probably the coldest its been for many of us in a while. A big thank you to our Maintenance Employees who have worked hard to keep up with snow plowing, working very late nights, early mornings and holidays. P ROPERTIES There are currently 562 Homes, 28 Contiguous lots, 283 Undeveloped Lots and 38 CLCA owned Lots in the Community. Twenty six resale packets have been issued since July 2013. Sales of properties have included undeveloped land, foreclosures and owner sales. T A x S ALES In November the Community purchased Lots 1601, 4006, 2419, 1623,6009, 5218 and 5723 from the Pike Tax Respository. These lots were offered to Conashaugh for purchase to be used for Clean and Green Areas. The price charged for each lot was 25.00. The lots cannot be sold or developed under the agreement of the purchase. Tax Sales offer good deals on properties; however, anyone considering purchasing a property needs to do their home work. It is very important to check Deeds for right of first refusal clauses or other restrictions that remain with the property until removed legally. Depending on the type of sale you will also need to check to see if liens, unpaid dues or mortgages are applicable. R OADS Wayco arrived on October 10 and began needed maintenance and repair work on Pequot, Sandy Pine, Lenape and Overbrook. One of the areas that needed to be addressed was a section of Overbrook Run between the intersections of Cree Trail and Flatbrook where water draining from wetlands located on the green area between Gwinnett, Oneida, Braxton and Overbrook was causing the road to collapse in the center. A drain pipe was installed to help better distribute Community Happenings By Jeanne Calabrese water passing under the roadway and then the pavement was repaired. Lower Overbrook between Seneca and Conashaugh were showing severe signs of deterioration and were top coated with asphalt. Unfortunately, this year funds did not allow for the paving of any unpaved roads. Repairs to Lenape were to finish repairs that were made in 2012. I LLUMINATED S IGN Following an approval by the Board in September, a new illuminated sign and wind cover were purchased for the mailboxrecycling area. The sign has been temporarily and partially erected so that electrical conduits could be routed to where the permanent sign will stand. This was done in late fall before frost and freeze set in. Maintenance will be building a housing for the sign this spring and landscaping will also be done. The sign will be illuminated and used to post events and alerts for the community. P OOL As previously reported the pool received a new liner, tile work and skimmers before the start of the 2013 season. A new winter pool cover was purchased and installed in October. We are currently accepting applications for lifeguards at the office. Lifeguards must be certified. T RAINING Maintenance Foreman Dave Altemier attended a two day course in November that covered unpaved roads. The class was a Dirt Road Maintenance training program and it took place at the Lords Valley TrainingCom Center. While Dave is highly experienced when it comes to this topic, feedback from him regarding the class was that the class was informative and provided information and reassurance that unpaved roads here are being maintained correctly. D UES 2013-14 Dues notices were mailed in early October. The deadline for submitting a plan and payment was November 15th. Thank you to our members who have made dues a priority. If you are reading this and have not received your dues notice, please contact the office as soon as possible. In November accounts for 45 properties which included multiply owned properties by single owners, unpaid judgments and members who have been out of contact with the office regarding delinquent dues, were referred to Sunrise Credit for collections. After ninety days from assignment, unsuccessful collection files will be referred to the District Magistrate for judgments. This is an unfortunate step to take, however one that must be taken. On several occasions members have stated that they wish that they could have worked something out or, we should have called them. Reminders are mailed andor emailed to members who are delinquent, several times each year. When members do not respond to the reminders andor make no attempt to maintain a payment plan, it leaves us no option. To avoid collections, please keep in contact with the office and make sure that you are consistent with making payments. As a reminder files referred to collections andor the Magistrate will not be recalled until dues and expenses are settled. R ECYCLING Effective November 12, 2013 the recycling pick up day was changed from Friday to Tuesday. As a reminder, please crush all boxes and do not put Styrofoam or plastic bags in the recycle bins. only plastic bags containing shreds may be placed in bins. Also as of September 1, 2013 recycling of certain materials is mandatory in Dingman Township and the burning of trash is prohibited. On a similar note we were notified by the Township that burning of yard waste was also prohibited. An inquiry and information supplied by one of our residents on this subject led to an inquiry to Dingman Township. It was learned that the law is under review by the Township and that the ban to burn yard waste is voluntary until further notice. All procedures set forth in Town Ordinances and Community rules must be followed when burning. If you have any questions, please contact the office. O FFICE R EPAIRS Mold and damaged insulation were found in the crawl space of the office. Bids were obtained and Cassagrande Contracting removed and replaced insulation and cleaned up the mold condition and an outlet and fan for circulation was installed. Work was completed in November. S ALT S HED This building is used to store winter road materials. The original roof was deteriorating and the T-111 siding was showing signs of wear. A new roof was installed over the summer and vinyl siding was completed in the fall to extend the life of the building. A NNUAL F INANCIAL A UDIT Each year our books are independently audited. Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska are currently conducting an audit of Conashaughs records for 2012-2013. Results of the audit are due in February.

We have found these small whip-it canisters laying on the ground in the beach parking area as well as alongside the road. see attachment When used to make whipped cream as intended, they are harmless. However, many people are using them as inhalants these days to get highthe canisters contain nitrous oxide. They can be purchased at Walmart legally as part of kits to make whipped cream which makes them easily accessible. I didnt know what these canisters were until I had to complete some drug abuse awareness training for my job. It would be worth passing this along to security. They may already be well aware of these itemsin the case they are not, it would be good for them to know of this problem. The information was shared with security along with a picture of the packaging for the items of concern. We are just sharing this info for our parents and guardians so that they may be aware as well. PennDOT Donates Supplies for Clean Up Day By Jeanne Calabrese Thanks to CLCA member Cheryl Hussey who facilitated a donation of supplies from PennDOT for CLCAs Clean Up Day last spring. Items donated included safety vests, work gloves and trash bags. Clean up day was held in conjunction with CLCA Dumpster Day. A total of 15 volunteers worked cleaning up roads and waterways, recycling metals and electronics as well as hauling large amounts of trash into dumpsters. Dumpster Day workers included Neil Johnson, Larry Farnum, Fred Kline, Joe Kistle and Mike Stevenson. The road clean up crew included Annette and Josh Musano, Kate Green, Gary Dolgoff, Scott and Elizabeth Bailey and Jeanne Calabrese. The spring dumpster day yielded a total of 16 tons of trash. A second dumpster day was held in September. That collection yielded 9.05 tons of trash. Volunteers for the fall Dumpster Day included Neil Johnson, Bob Weed, David Weed, Mike Stevenson, Larry Farnum, Fred Kline and Joe Kistle. Thank you to all the volunteers who participated. If anyone would like to organize a road clean up or help with Dumpster Day this spring, please contact the office.

Building Important Reminders Regarding Snow Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicle at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and is a Safety Violation subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe.

Those are the words that are heard often as January turns to February and thoughts of warm spring weather seem silly at best. As winter is wrapping up and the excitement of the coming spring is upon us we can prepare for the months to come by doing some things in the garden. Quick, before the buds appear, now is the perfect time to prune your deciduous trees and late-blooming shrubs while they are still dormant. Always prune with a purpose: to get rid of sprouts growing at or near the base of the tree trunk, to remove dead, broken or crossed branches, to make plants more shapely opening up the center of the plant for good air circulation and sun exposure. Be careful with flowering shrubs that formed their buds in the late fall; pruning will result in losing flowers this spring, so prune wisely As temperatures begin to warm, and plants emerge from dormancy, slowly remove protective mulches. Dont remove too early. A warm day may make you think spring is almost here but there may be more cold weather to come, and hard freezes are still possible. A good guide for plant performance under local, low temperature conditions is the plant hardiness zone map. Our area is classified as zone 5b. That means a plant described as hardy to zone 5b can withstand a minimum temperature of -15F. Keep in mind that climatic factors such as wind and sun exposure, snow cover and proximity to water combine to produce different microclimates which can influence plant adaptability and timing of certain garden chores. Endless hours of enjoyment await you, but you have to pay your dues in the late winter and early spring. If you meet the plants basic requirements, they will be happy and your yard will be amazingly beautiful. Happy Gardening from the Ladybug. New Sign!

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2014 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION Committees: Why Bother; All is Well! By Bob Weed Conashaugh Lakes is consistently ranked as one of the best private Communities in NEPA. We all know this is the result of several factors, but perhaps the most important is the time, energy and devotion given by Community Members to the several Committees which help all Community Members communicate with the Board of Directors. In turn, the Board acts on what is has been informed is necessary to the continued well-being of the Community. I speak for myself here as Liaison to the Rules and Regulations Committee, but I know what I say is equally true of the other Committees. There has been no interest in attending the Rules and Regs meetings for months held, you may note, every third Tuesday evening at 7 PM at the Rec Building. The reason, I believe, is obvious: All is Well in every aspect of the maintaining of the Communitys interest, concerns and welfare. We have, apparently, achieved a level of excellence and efficiency at which all are quite comfortable; not only comfortable, but complacent; not only complacent, but convinced that All is Well. And when an entire Community is convinced, Utopia is upon us. Now there are those would argue the reverse; that all is so unwell that all the members have lost hope, faith and dedication to the Promise that was Conashaugh Lakes. Couple those with individuals who prefer to suffer in silence and you have the very beginning of the crumbling of the Promise, of the slow decay of that Promise, the final withering of that Promise. How is it with you, Well or Unwell? A Plea from y our Neighbor By Jeanne Calabrese When asked for suggestions for an article for this issue of the Conashaugh Courier, it was requested by one of your neighbors that an article be written reminding residents to PLEASE drive within the speed limits. It doesnt matter where this neighbor lives. They may live next door, down the block or on the road that you speed down on your way to the mailbox, bus stop, shopping, work pick one or perhaps they live on the intersection where you run that stop sign because no one is there. Unfortunately, despite repeated reminders written in past articles, on Facebook postings and via the LOOP, there are some who just dont get it and continue to do their own thing and disregard the hazards they place upon their neighbors, themselves and their own children. Since the summer there has been an increase of members reporting others for traffic violations including but not limited to speeding, illegal passing, reckless driving, running stop signs and tailgating through the entrance gates. Some have even filed formal complaints resulting in violations with fines being issued. And yes, that can happen and it has. Of course just as with any other violation that may be issued, the recipient has the right to due process a hearing. Please slow down, please. Your neighbor has asked that you include in your resolutions for 2014 a promise to drive safely because the heartache you save may be your own.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2014 PAGE 6 When he discovered that Apples App Store lacked what he was looking for, Mr. Douglas Merritt, current resident and Physics teacher at Mountain Lakes HS in NJ, decided to take things into his own hands. He designed his own apps! It took a lot of research and experimentation, but he is of course a science teacher. As of now, Mr. Merritt has four apps available for purchase in the App Store. He has also created a website for his app designs, called The Fizix Group. It all began a few years ago with linearization. To replace the hassle of laptops for the whole class, Mr. Merritt wanted a program that could automatically linearize the experimental data his students collected and be accessed from smartphones. He was fairly certain that someone would have invented one already. But he found nothing. Ive been using Apple products since 1988, Mr. Merritt says. So why not design his own Apple-facilitated program? He flipped through the Xcode tutorials included with his Apple products and learned that it cost nearly one hundred dollars to join Apples development team. I was thinking, thats kind of a lot of money to spend on something Im not sure Ill really use. Would it be worth it? he wondered. According to Mr. Merritt, two common practice apps for beginners are calculators and quadratic function solvers. With this in mind, he chose the quadratic solver to learn programming before he would tackle the linearization app. He displays the un-updated version, explaining what features were missing from the original program. This was what it used to be, but when Id show it to people, theyd say, Wow, thats so cool, but what if it did this, too? People were suggesting things left and right! Mr. Merritt says. Now, the version in the App Store not only solves the quadratic equation, but displays the answer in radical form, lists pertinent values such as the discriminant, graphs the function, enables zoom and scroll, and displays the coordinates of Need Help Solving The Quadratic Equation? By Maddy DiGiovanni points when they are tapped. A very useful tool if you are enrolled in a class such as pre-Calc, Trigonometry, or Physics. Another of his apps is a temperature converter. After perusing several CelsiusFahrenheit converters already published in the App Store, Mr. Merritt noticed that none of them included the Kelvin scale. How lame is that?! he exclaims, an incredulous look on his face. Naturally, he wrote a program including Kelvin. His engineering professor friend, however, was still unsatisfied. I showed it to him, Mr. Merritt recalls, and he said, You forgot Rankines! and I was thinking, What on earth is a Rankine After learning that the Rankine scale is a temperature measurement system commonly used by engineers, he edited his program to include that as well. Moreover, instead of purchasing a sound file for number-pad sounds, he simply recorded himself clicking a pen and programmed that in, too. If you ever use his Cool Converter, you will know that the sound effects are genuinely Mr. Merritts. Mr. Merritt also has two other apps on the app store. One is an app specifically for his seniors. Called RUExempt it helps his seniors calculate if they are exempt from finals, one of the last senior privileges of the year. The other is a social media app for a friend that is in the stamping business. Titled Pooler, this app gives access to a very talented stamper named Catherine Pooler. It has her blog, where you can post messages, Facebook feed, and twitter feed. Now, Mr. Merritt is returning to the idea that started it all. He hopes to begin work on the linearization app soon. In the meantime, be sure to check out his four current publications in the App Store; The Blue Quadratic Solver, Cool Converter, RUExempt, and Pooler. Just go to the store and type in any of the titles. Hope this helps with your homework! CLC ASSOCIATION",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2014 PAGE 7 Heads Up! Road Ban Ahead! By Jeanne Calabrese With winter past the halfway mark, it is time to remind everyone that road bans are imminent. This may be old news to some of our members. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVWgross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid February into March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non- emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation. Got Stuff? Dont forget to send your CLCA non-commercial Classifieds to clcaloopptd.net.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2014 PAGE 8 Happy New Year. I think. Weve had our share of snow and ice this winter. As I am writing this, the temperature for the second round so far this season is in the negative digits. Its probably the coldest its been for many of us in a while. A big thank you to our Maintenance Employees who have worked hard to keep up with snow plowing, working very late nights, early mornings and holidays. P ROPERTIES There are currently 562 Homes, 28 Contiguous lots, 283 Undeveloped Lots and 38 CLCA owned Lots in the Community. Twenty six resale packets have been issued since July 2013. Sales of properties have included undeveloped land, foreclosures and owner sales. T A x S ALES In November the Community purchased Lots 1601, 4006, 2419, 1623,6009, 5218 and 5723 from the Pike Tax Respository. These lots were offered to Conashaugh for purchase to be used for Clean and Green Areas. The price charged for each lot was 25.00. The lots cannot be sold or developed under the agreement of the purchase. Tax Sales offer good deals on properties; however, anyone considering purchasing a property needs to do their home work. It is very important to check Deeds for right of first refusal clauses or other restrictions that remain with the property until removed legally. Depending on the type of sale you will also need to check to see if liens, unpaid dues or mortgages are applicable. R OADS Wayco arrived on October 10 and began needed maintenance and repair work on Pequot, Sandy Pine, Lenape and Overbrook. One of the areas that needed to be addressed was a section of Overbrook Run between the intersections of Cree Trail and Flatbrook where water draining from wetlands located on the green area between Gwinnett, Oneida, Braxton and Overbrook was causing the road to collapse in the center. A drain pipe was installed to help better distribute Community Happenings By Jeanne Calabrese water passing under the roadway and then the pavement was repaired. Lower Overbrook between Seneca and Conashaugh were showing severe signs of deterioration and were top coated with asphalt. Unfortunately, this year funds did not allow for the paving of any unpaved roads. Repairs to Lenape were to finish repairs that were made in 2012. I LLUMINATED S IGN Following an approval by the Board in September, a new illuminated sign and wind cover were purchased for the mailboxrecycling area. The sign has been temporarily and partially erected so that electrical conduits could be routed to where the permanent sign will stand. This was done in late fall before frost and freeze set in. Maintenance will be building a housing for the sign this spring and landscaping will also be done. The sign will be illuminated and used to post events and alerts for the community. P OOL As previously reported the pool received a new liner, tile work and skimmers before the start of the 2013 season. A new winter pool cover was purchased and installed in October. We are currently accepting applications for lifeguards at the office. Lifeguards must be certified. T RAINING Maintenance Foreman Dave Altemier attended a two day course in November that covered unpaved roads. The class was a Dirt Road Maintenance training program and it took place at the Lords Valley TrainingCom Center. While Dave is highly experienced when it comes to this topic, feedback from him regarding the class was that the class was informative and provided information and reassurance that unpaved roads here are being maintained correctly. D UES 2013-14 Dues notices were mailed in early October. The deadline for submitting a plan and payment was November 15th. Thank you to our members who have made dues a priority. If you are reading this and have not received your dues notice, please contact the office as soon as possible. In November accounts for 45 properties which included multiply owned properties by single owners, unpaid judgments and members who have been out of contact with the office regarding delinquent dues, were referred to Sunrise Credit for collections. After ninety days from assignment, unsuccessful collection files will be referred to the District Magistrate for judgments. This is an unfortunate step to take, however one that must be taken. On several occasions members have stated that they wish that they could have worked something out or, we should have called them. Reminders are mailed andor emailed to members who are delinquent, several times each year. When members do not respond to the reminders andor make no attempt to maintain a payment plan, it leaves us no option. To avoid collections, please keep in contact with the office and make sure that you are consistent with making payments. As a reminder files referred to collections andor the Magistrate will not be recalled until dues and expenses are settled. R ECYCLING Effective November 12, 2013 the recycling pick up day was changed from Friday to Tuesday. As a reminder, please crush all boxes and do not put Styrofoam or plastic bags in the recycle bins. only plastic bags containing shreds may be placed in bins. Also as of September 1, 2013 recycling of certain materials is mandatory in Dingman Township and the burning of trash is prohibited. On a similar note we were notified by the Township that burning of yard waste was also prohibited. An inquiry and information supplied by one of our residents on this subject led to an inquiry to Dingman Township. It was learned that the law is under review by the Township and that the ban to burn yard waste is voluntary until further notice. All procedures set forth in Town Ordinances and Community rules must be followed when burning. If you have any questions, please contact the office. O FFICE R EPAIRS Mold and damaged insulation were found in the crawl space of the office. Bids were obtained and Cassagrande Contracting removed and replaced insulation and cleaned up the mold condition and an outlet and fan for circulation was installed. Work was completed in November. S ALT S HED This building is used to store winter road materials. The original roof was deteriorating and the T-111 siding was showing signs of wear. A new roof was installed over the summer and vinyl siding was completed in the fall to extend the life of the building. A NNUAL F INANCIAL A UDIT Each year our books are independently audited. Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska are currently conducting an audit of Conashaughs records for 2012-2013. Results of the audit are due in February.

We have found these small whip-it canisters laying on the ground in the beach parking area as well as alongside the road. see attachment When used to make whipped cream as intended, they are harmless. However, many people are using them as inhalants these days to get highthe canisters contain nitrous oxide. They can be purchased at Walmart legally as part of kits to make whipped cream which makes them easily accessible. I didnt know what these canisters were until I had to complete some drug abuse awareness training for my job. It would be worth passing this along to security. They may already be well aware of these itemsin the case they are not, it would be good for them to know of this problem. The information was shared with security along with a picture of the packaging for the items of concern. We are just sharing this info for our parents and guardians so that they may be aware as well. PennDOT Donates Supplies for Clean Up Day By Jeanne Calabrese Thanks to CLCA member Cheryl Hussey who facilitated a donation of supplies from PennDOT for CLCAs Clean Up Day last spring. Items donated included safety vests, work gloves and trash bags. Clean up day was held in conjunction with CLCA Dumpster Day. A total of 15 volunteers worked cleaning up roads and waterways, recycling metals and electronics as well as hauling large amounts of trash into dumpsters. Dumpster Day workers included Neil Johnson, Larry Farnum, Fred Kline, Joe Kistle and Mike Stevenson. The road clean up crew included Annette and Josh Musano, Kate Green, Gary Dolgoff, Scott and Elizabeth Bailey and Jeanne Calabrese. The spring dumpster day yielded a total of 16 tons of trash. A second dumpster day was held in September. That collection yielded 9.05 tons of trash. Volunteers for the fall Dumpster Day included Neil Johnson, Bob Weed, David Weed, Mike Stevenson, Larry Farnum, Fred Kline and Joe Kistle. Thank you to all the volunteers who participated. If anyone would like to organize a road clean up or help with Dumpster Day this spring, please contact the office.",

Building Important Reminders Regarding Snow Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicle at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and is a Safety Violation subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe. CONASHAUGH NEWS",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2014 PAGE 14 OUTDOOR  RECREATION Garden Ideas and Tips for Late Winter and Early Spring Will winter ever end? Those are the words that are heard often as January turns to February and thoughts of warm spring weather seem silly at best. As winter is wrapping up and the excitement of the coming spring is upon us we can prepare for the months to come by doing some things in the garden. Quick, before the buds appear, now is the perfect time to prune your deciduous trees and late-blooming shrubs while they are still dormant. Always prune with a purpose: to get rid of sprouts growing at or near the base of the tree trunk, to remove dead, broken or crossed branches, to make plants more shapely opening up the center of the plant for good air circulation and sun exposure. Be careful with flowering shrubs that formed their buds in the late fall; pruning will result in losing flowers this spring, so prune wisely As temperatures begin to warm, and plants emerge from dormancy, slowly remove protective mulches. Dont remove too early. A warm day may make you think spring is almost here but there may be more cold weather to come, and hard freezes are still possible. A good guide for plant performance under local, low temperature conditions is the plant hardiness zone map. Our area is classified as zone 5b. That means a plant described as hardy to zone 5b can withstand a minimum temperature of -15F. Keep in mind that climatic factors such as wind and sun exposure, snow cover and proximity to water combine to produce different microclimates which can influence plant adaptability and timing of certain garden chores. Endless hours of enjoyment await you, but you have to pay your dues in the late winter and early spring. If you meet the plants basic requirements, they will be happy and your yard will be amazingly beautiful. Happy Gardening from the Ladybug. New Sign! Our maintenance staff setting up the area for the new sign in the mailbox area.",

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20152016 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting always takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 26th. This year it will be held at the St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Despite folk lore and tales of insanity past, the meetings of the last several years have gone smoothly albeit are lightly attended. Refreshments will be served. Approximately one month before the meeting all members are mailed a ballot. Owners are permitted one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail or in person. If you are returning your ballot by mail, it is important that you use the provided envelope addressed to our Accountants, Beck, Gogolski and Poska. Please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed by us as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office.

As President of the CLCA board of Directors, I can assure you that the members of the Board are strong advocates for the interests of our Community Members. We work hard to represent your interest by working with Office staff to see that everything done is for the benefit of all members, both young and old. The Board of Directors and the staff in the Office are always concerned that all we do is for your benefit and no one elses. This year we have again accomplished road paving with one dirt road paved and several others updated to maintain their condition as they age. We intend to pave another dirt road next year. Maintaining the roads that are already paved are a priority. This year we were able to pave more length of road using a tar and chip application. This method is less expensive than traditional paving and allows for the life of a road to be extended. It wont allow the time between re-paving to be as long as the previous methods. It should help in allowing us to pave all or a portion of a dirt road each year. Paving all or a portion of a dirt road is my goal. Many ask how it is decided which dirt road will be paved. Several factors go into deciding this such as the number of developed properties on a road, length of the road, traffic use for the road, cost to maintain the unpaved road and last but not least money available to do the paving. Also this year we were able to replace the Grader that was purchased in 1970 at a cost of 42,000. At a 3 inflation rate over the years the cost to replace it would have been 98,700.00. We were able to purchase a newer, used grader for  45,825 while receiving 22,000 for our trade in. Late this year the Ford F350 reached the end of its life and we have replaced it with a used Chevrolet Silverado. The F350 was purchased in 2006 at a cost of 68,000 wplow. We received 4,000 trade in against the cost of a Fleet Lease return vehicle for 49,000. All of the above purchases were accomplished using Reserve Money. Reserves accounts are funded by allocating money every year in the budget for Reserves There are two Reserve Accounts. One is for Roads and the other is General Reserves. Thank You CLIP  SAVE CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 4 Office Notes J EANNE C ALABRESE Summer did not delay her arrival this year. She gave spring the old heave ho with temperatures in May jumping from freezing to the 80s. Welcome to NEPA. Despite an early drought watch for our area we had a very wet June and first couple of weeks in July. Even with the rain work was accomplished. Roads were repaired and paved much earlier than in years past. Generally extensive road work took place in late August into September, but the Board of Directors wanted to get a jump on the work and take advantage of summer weather to allow leveling courses to cure before tar and chip was applied. Much has happened since the last issue of the Courier. Some of which you can read below. Mailbox Area In January the mailbox area sign was illuminated. It previously did not have an onoff switch and required manually pulling a plug each night. A timer was purchased and installed for illuminating the sign. The timer has a photocell allowing the sign to illuminate at dusk and remain on for six hours. The Maintenance department completed construction and installation of a bulletin board as well as extending the ground area surrounding that and the recycle bins. Roads As mentioned in the Presidents message, previously unpaved Gwinnett Road was fully paved. In addition tar and chip applications were done to Cree, Cayuga, Pine Grove and a section of Seneca. Maintenance repaired and applied new materials to unpaved roads including lower Overbrook, Junco, White Tail and Water Lily and performed maintenance on other non-paved roads. This might seem a little early and you may be sitting poolside reading this now but within a couple of months may be into the throes of an early snowfall. Please be aware that we do not have a bare road policy when it comes to snow removal. During minor snow events we sometimes receive inquiries as to why maintenance is not out plowing. Please understand that plows are not out immediately when snow starts to fly. Sometimes snow fall can last for a majority of the day however just over an inch accumulates. Anti skid applied during other snow and rain events can still be evident through the new snow. Due to the cost of materials combined with the fact that the snow amounts do not require plowing, only sides of the main and other paved roads may be cut back leaving the anti skid in the center. Social media experts reporting on various other sites make it difficult at times. People reporting horrible conditions for various roadshighwayscommunities stirs up readers and other commentators when sometimes no such conditions exist. Some feel they need to see the pavement for roads to be satisfactory. A lack of traffic combined with low temperatures can prevent roads from baring down to pavement even on the most sunny day. Unlike PennDot we do not have waves of people sitting in the wings waiting to tag team the next shift. Our workers come in at all times, even Holidays, even after having worked a whole day earlier and do a great job with keeping our roads as safe as possible. For the record, we dont pre-treat roads in our Community. We actually use very little salt on the roads a one to three ratio with anti-skid. It often amazes me when I see and hear comments about salting the roads. With wells and waterways why would we want to do that? The salt has to go somewhere when it runs off the road. It is also quite expensive and when temperatures get below certain points is useless. Dues All dues payment plans need to be paid up by August 28th. Gate cards are deactivated monthly for non- payment of dues. If the account continues in this status the mailbox is locked down and then the account is referred to collections. Security Sargent Sara Gabell and Officer Aaron Duckett resgined from United American Security in early January. Sara to pursue another career and Aaron to attend college. Officer Ray Kelejian was CLC ASSOCIATION CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 5 assinged by UAS to assume Saras role when she departed. A Training Guide for CLCA operations was assembled and given to Security personnel. In-house training was also offered to UAS Staff. The alarm panel in the office which was over ten years old failed. Our alarm Company, Vector installed a new panel which was covered by our maintenance contract with them. Fire Damaged Homes One of two fire damaged homes on Seneca was demolished. The second of the homes remains standing but was boarded in July after multiple requests followed by a demand and threat to take legal action by our Attorney. The property was originally going to be fenced at the request of the owners attorney but it was boarded instead. It has been reported that the insurance company and estate for the remaining home is in settlement negotiations and the home will be eventually demolished. Electric In an effort to reduce energy costs the Board approved an offer by Inspire Energy in February for generation charges. Since there has been inconsistent feedback regarding different energy companies, it was decided to test the offer for lower costs by using this company on only one of our nine meters. As of this date there has not been a remarkable difference noted in the cost for the meter. We are not bound in a contract to continue using this company and will monitor further before deciding to change back or turnover additional accounts. Volunteer Thanks Member Laura Elaro started a Poke Mon club in February which met on Wednesdays during the school year. Laura is also a Girl Scout Leader in our Community as are members Pam Wood and Debbie Boulanger. Thanks for all you do! Member Elena Luyando is always there with her camera, capturing photos for us to share. Thank you Elena for your contributions and for your important work with the Boy Scouts. Thank you to Lynn and John McCauley who also dedicate their time volunteering with the Scouts. Thank you to Jessica Olcott and Barbara Hamilton along with Kristen Kelleher for getting the Easter Bunny to our Annual Easter Egg Hunt. Members of the community were treated on the last day of school. Brian and Barbara Hamilton were on hand to dish out ice cream at the Rec Building. Special thanks to Regina Knight, Neil Johnson, Larry Farnum, Joe Kistle, Mike Stevenson, Fred Kline and Josef Lalor for their part with helping at the Dumpster Day held in May. Fishing Day was held May 5th and it was probably one of the most beautiful weather days we have had for this event. Volunteers Neil Johnson, Eddie Calabrese, Larry Farnum, Joe Kistle and Victor Perez who are there each year along with others were once again there helping to bait hooks, remove fish and untangle lines. As of this writing, planning is under way for the CLCA Annual Picnic scheduled to be held on Saturday August 22nd. Thank you to chairpersons Michael Bulger and Lynn McCauley who along with a number of other members in the Community worked hard planning and preparing for this event. Last but certainly not least, thank you to our Board Members for their work! Tax Sales For the May Judicial Sale there were a total of seven properties in Conashaugh listed for tax sale. Not surprising but all of these lots also have delinquent dues. Currently there are eleven CLCA properties in Repository. For information regarding tax sales in Pike County go to http: www.pikepa.orgtax.html. Trash and Recycling There has been a sharp decline in folks leaving garbage on the ground at the compactor along with no reported incidents of folks using the recycling bins as their personal dumpsters for several months now. Some other good trash related news is that the Board approved continuing the second pick up of recycling beyond Labor Day. Recycling does have an impact on the costs for trash removal. We ask all of our members to please recycle. New signs were installed on the compactor doors which should be very clear about what not to put in the compactor and the consequences for leaving trash. Dumpster day was held May 2nd. Four dumpsters used, three were for general trash, one was for metal. Delivery cost 3 dumpsters was 225.00 each. Cost per ton for contents 75.00. Fall 2015 Dumpster Day is scheduled to take place Saturday, October 17th. A total of 11.13 tons of trash was collected excluding metal during Spring 2015 Dumpster Day. Pennsylvania Child Protection Laws Amended Following a heads up by one of our members, we were notified by the Board of Health regarding requirements for anyone over the age of 14 whose job involves regular contact with children. Pool employees were required to obtain multiple clearances in order to work under this amendment. The law change also affected requirements for volunteers in the State who have regular contact with children. Rules Reminders  Dogs must be kept from roaming-do not allow your dog to run at large-  Permits are required to be obtained before removing any tree in excess of 1 inch  Permits andor approval from CLCA is needed for sheds, decks, extensions, roof replacement, exterior siding  painting. This is only a partial list of improvements requiring permits. Depending on what type of work you are completing you may also need a town permit. If you have any questions, please contact the office.  Do not leave trash on the ground if the compactor is closed or full. Please be sure your guests andor children are aware of this rule if they are taking out your trash.  Leaves and other yard debris are not permitted in the compactors.  Vehicles that area not registeredinspected road worthy are not to be stored on members properties. It is also a violation of Dingman Township Ordinance. Information regarding violations and fines associated with them can be found in your CLCA Blue Book. If you do not have one, please contact the office for a replacement. BSA Volunteer Recognition Dinner The Volunteer Recognition Dinner was held March 28th at the Kuhls Highland House. CLCA Member John McCauley received the Council Presidents Recognition For Exemplifying the Scouting Spirit of Selfless Service to Others While Supporting The Primary Mission of the Hudson Valley Council of Service to Youth CLC ASSOCIATION CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION CLCA Bus Stop BY J EANNE C ALABRESE K of C Council 12571 First Sundays Dinner The Knights of Columbus Council 12571 have been serving dinner on the first Sunday of each month since September of 2014 at St. John Neumann Parish Hall. Those who are experiencing financial difficulties or are in need of socialization are invited free of charge to dinner served between 2:00-4:00. Members of the Knights cook and serve the meal restaurant-style to those attending. A full course menu and dessert are provided. The menus vary each month such as roast beef, turkey, ham, Italian and Spanish. All are welcome. Anyone planning to attend is asked to call the parish office Mon., Thurs, Fri. 775-0681 or Bob DElia at 775- 9826 on Tuesday and Wednesday. We have many new residents with children in the Community who will be using the bus stop for the first time. For those of you who are new here, our school bus lot is located in front of the CLCA Office. Last year there were a total of five buses; two high school, one middle school and two elementaryprimary. We do not have a bus total for this year as of this writing. Bus schedules are mailed by the Delaware Valley School District. It is very important to leave enough time to arrive at least five minutes before your scheduled bus. This planning is especially important in winter weather. Dont wait until the last minute to leave to only find your windshield covered in ice. Take time to clean ice off your windshield properly. Driving with a plate sized port hole for a window is unsafe at best. Please stop at stop signs and do not speed. Children should be in seat belts and not hanging out of windows or a sunroof. You hopefully wouldnt drive down Route 739 or 84 with kids hanging out all over or sitting in your lap; why oh why would you take a chance and do it in the Community. Accidents can and do happen here. The impact of an airbag can kill or maim your child. Reminders for Bus Lot  Do not park, drop off or pick up students outside the bus lot. It is not safe for children or adults to be crossing exit or entrance lanes of the main entrance.  Parking lot lanes are one way, please follow signage  Parking lot speed limit is 5 mph  Follow directions if and when given by Security or Bus Monitors  The bus gate exit is for buses only- no cars are to use this exit  Once a departing bus starts moving, do not attempt to stop or block it - 500 fine. Bus drivers are not stopping for late arrivals  Procedures for the ElementaryPrimary School AFTERNOON PICK UPS ONLY- These buses will park in the travel lane located directly behind the front Conashaugh sign instead of the bus depot to discharge students. Vehicles are not permitted to moveleave the lot while these buses are present. If you arrive after the buses have entered the lot you are permitted to park in the bus depot area. Do not wait in or troll the aisles and do not pull up behind buses. Vehicles that have arrived lateparked in the bus depot will likely be the last to leave the lot. Plan accordingly. The first days of school are exciting for parents and kids alike and there typically are more cars than normal during those days especially for the ElementaryPrimary buses. There will likely be a number of folks new to the bus stop experience.

A Happy welcome to the Hofmann family who arrived to our Community in June.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 7 CLC ASSOCIATION 2015 Treasurers Report BY F RED K LINE As mentioned in my Presidents Report we have accomplished much this year by using monies that have been set aside over the years in our Reserve funds. In addition, some funds were used from our Capital Improvement Account to transform our latest road from unpaved to paved. CLCA uses funds from a number of accounts to accomplish everything from major purchases to day to day operations. Those accounts include Operating Accounts, General Reserves, Road Reserves and Capital Improvement. We are fortunate to have Reserves Accounts as there are a number of associations that do not have any or only a small amount in Reserve. This I discovered as a member of AOCA. AOCA is an acronym for Alliance of Community Associations. The Alliance was started several years ago by our past President John Crerand. The purpose of this group is to share knowledge of various laws and techniques for accomplishing various tasks associated with being a community. Over the years much has been learned by presentations given by various invited speakers. We also share experiences as Community leaders. It is a place where we do our best to help each other with current issues as well as hurdles that may lay in the future. The cost of running an Association is costly and the success of doing so relies on our members paying their dues. I have been working with our dedicated office staff in pursuing those who choose to ignore their responsibility. Many dont realize that their property deed spells this obligation out. You cant plow streets, maintain roads, trim and cut grass, maintain the pool, keep the beach clean and drainage ditches clear, repair facilities, plus the many other things that need doing without funds to do them. In addition to the expense of labor there is the ever increasing cost of doing business. To mention a few which all of you also have is the cost of electricity, fuel, telephones, office equipment and supplies, maintenance of equipment, repair of broken gates and willful damage to property of the association. So in closing I would like for all of you to emphasize on any and all contacts that you make at the pool, mailbox, recycle, trash, how important it is that everyone pays their share of the expense of running this Association. Having said all that, I would like to take this opportunity to ask that you approve this years proposed budget with its modest 1 increase. A copy of the proposed budget can be found in this publication. Thank You Last Day of School Ice Cream Event! CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 8 CONASHAUGH NEWS JOSEPH L. KISTLE My name is Joseph L. Kistle. I have been on the CLCA Board of Directors for three years and am now running for a second term. I am the Board Liaison for the Maintenance Committee. I have also volunteered working CLCA Dumpster Days and Fishing Club events. I am a retired police detective with 28 years experience in police work. My wife Rose and I have been married for 58 years, have 3 children and 9 grandchildren. I am a 1955 graduate of Franklin High School, Franklin, New Jersey. After graduating I ventured into the work field and after many years of hard work, I became the owneroperator of a very successful business, Kistle Heating Service. After twenty-five years of owning a business, I decided it was time for a change. We moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where I started my career in police work at the El Paso County Sheriff s Department as a Deputy Sheriff. I was a Deputy Sheriff for 3 12 years before moving back to New Jersey due to a family illness. Upon returning to New Jersey, I continued my career in police work as a patrolman with the Ogdensburg Police Department, Ogdensburg, New Jersey, for 7 years. I then went to the Franklin Police Department, Franklin, New Jersey, as a patrolman for 10 years and was promoted to the position of Detective Sergeant which I held for 8 years until my retirement. My interests include hunting, fishing, baseball, softball, golf and football. I played on numerous teams for many years including playing seven years semi-pro football with the Atlantic Coast League. I remain very interested in the affairs of the Community and would like to continue as a member of the Board. Sincerely, Joseph L. Kistle CLCA ELECTIONS Joseph L. Kistle B ILL K ING In 2014, I semi-retired and moved full time to Conashaugh Lakes with my wife, Karen. We love the wild life and serenity of the community. I grew up on the tide waters of the Chesapeake Bay in southern Marylands farm country, fishing, crabbing, hunting and farming. As a teenager I spent summers working on a tobacco farm during the day while catching and selling crabs early in the morning. I worked my way through college as an auto parts clerk and graduated from the University of Maryland with a BS in Accounting. Shortly after college I joined Motorola where I spent the next 27 years. Leaving Motorola in 2006 I subsequently worked for two other companies based out of New York City, Brookwood Companies Incorporated and The New York Leadership Center, Inc. Employment has kept my wife and I moving around. Beginning with my home state of Maryland, we have also lived in Chicago, Dallas, south Florida, northern New Jersey, and New York City. We hope to settle here in Conasaugh Lakes. The biggest lesson learned over the years is to treat all people fairly, transparently, and truthfully. We have two sons and a grandson and attend Milford Bible Church. Bill King Thanks For Your Generosity Conashaugh has been the beneficiary of a number of generous donations of materials and useable objects in recent months. Thank you Robert Kurlyck for your donation of a nice outdoor table for the picnic area. Members Fidel and Reggie Iglesias donated a number of lounge chairs for the pool area and chairs for the office. Valerie Ferlauto and Jerry Collotti donated cabinets to our Maintenance Department for their shop and Elizabeth Herman and Anthony Mann donated several pallets of pavers. Thank you to all for your donations. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 9 CONASHAUGH LETTERS ROADSIDE TRASH Including bags falling off cars  folks too darn lazy to go back and get them! Kids and teens, instead of bringing home bottles and bags from pool IN THEIR BAGS, leave on roadside--very disgusting AND they DO NOT volunteer for clean-ups! Fast food soda glasses tossed from cars--so disgusting, especially when dumpster is open until 10:00 P.M.! CLCA has more than enough garbage around. This practice of litter is total LAZINESS  in my opinion, reflects badly more on the kids than the adults! The occasional bag off the top of a car is just that--occasional; but the other litter reflects on the young people! Cigarette butts are EXTREMELY toxic to very young children. The colors, brown nicotine, yellow filter,  either yellow specks or white paper filters intrigue children ages 9 months-4 years. As they pull them apart and of course put them in their mouth, the carcinogens can harm OUR children. PLEASE, do not toss butts from car windows; lots of families use our roadways for walks. Thanks for listening to MY MAIN GRIPES Sincerely, Lynn McCauley M ICHAEL B ULGER My name is Michael Bulger and I am running for the board. I have lived in Conashaugh for nine years and have served on the board as the communitys treasurer from my second year here through my seventh. I was required to take two years off after serving six, so now Im running to go back on. As treasurer I tried to spend the communitys money as carefully as I would my own, holding any increases in dues to an average of about 1 a year while I was doing it. I was part of the subcommittee that created our roads fund which has been repaving roads the last few years, and I fought against putting us into debt by spending seven figures to build a new poolclubhouse that we didnt need. Instead we spent less than a tenth of that to re-side our current pool and that should last literally for decades to come. I have also co-hosted our annual picnic in the past and am doing so again this year. Elect me and I promise to look out for the community in the same way I did for the six years that I was on the board previously. Thanks.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 14 OUTDOOR  RECREATION Do You Bocce? B Y L ENNY M ARUCA Great news! Coming soon to Conashaugh at the picnic area will be our own Bocce court regulation size. I dont have an exact date but I hope by our Annual Picnic. My name is Lenny Maruca and I will be the first Bocce Captain setting up teams. How this works is every Monday for ten weeks at 3:00 p.m. two teams two people each will play against each other. After that the best two teams will have playoff. There will be regulation Bocce balls that you will use. This is just an outline. Once we know how many teams we have, more information you will receive. Some Bocce Facts: Bocce Italian: A ball sport belonging to the boules sport family, closely related to bowls and pentaque, with a common ancestry from ancient games played in the Roman Empire. Developed into its present form in Italy. Bocce was initially played among Italian migrants but has slowly become more popular with their descendants and a wider community. Bocce is traditionally played on natural sil and asphalt courts 27.5 meters90 ft. in length and 2.5 to 4 meters 8.2 to 13.1 ft. wide. Bocce balls can be made of metal or various kinds of plastic. Unlike Lawn bowls, bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias. A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the jack called a Boccino or Pallino in some areas, from one end of the court into a zone five meters16 ft in length ending 2.5 meters 8.2 ft. from the far end of the court If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone. The side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does not have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that are closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically 7 to 13 points. Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately. Anyone can play no matter what your age as long as you can hold the Bocce balls and understand the rules of the game. If you are interested in playing Bocce, please send me an email with the number of teams from your household. My email is lenjosverizon.net. Please indicate Bocce in the subject of the email.

The CLCA 20142015 fiscal year ends September 30 2015. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 15 LATE SUMMER  EARLY FALL GARDENING OUTDOOR  RECREATION Fall has distinct planting benefits. Pesky pests, especially mosquitoes, retreat due to cooler temperatures. You dont need to fertilize since it promotes new growth that can be nipped in winter. This is the prime time to prepare your yard for the next growing season. Septembers cooler air temperatures are easier on both plants and gardeners. Many perennials have a head start when planted in the autumn. Its the perfect time to get outside and transplant trees and shrubs and divide some of those spring and summer blooming perennials. The soil still retains warmth from the summers heat encouraging root growth until the ground freezes which is often weeks or even months after the first frost hits. Frost might seem like your biggest fall planting challenge, but actually its not a huge problem. Yes, frost will kill the tops of your new plants but it wont affect the root growth. Want free plants for your garden? Look for fat, plump seed pods. As they mature they swell up, stop growing and start turning brownish  thats the key sign to look for in most cases. Collect seeds by shaking them inside a paper envelope. Some of the easiest perennial flowers to collect seeds from include: Black-eyed Susan, Cone flower, Meadow rue, Obedient plant, Perennial Sunflower, Perennial sweet pea, Veronica. Once youre done collecting, write the name of the plant seed on the envelope and put it some place you wont forget. A shoe box makes a fine file cabinet for all those envelopes. If collecting and storing seeds is not for you, the late summer is usually bargain time as garden centers are trying to sell the last of their inventory before winter. At the end of the season, you can find discounts on plants that have passed their peak. Most nurseries knock down prices when their perennials go out of bloom and lower them even more when the plants start looking down and out. Expect to find perennials at 50 percent or more off. You know that section in the bargain area thats super cheap and its not hard to tell why. I call it death row, and its actually where I head first in the hopes of finding a steal. The plants often look pitiful, but some are still worth a shot. If its wilted, generally sad looking or has yellowing or dying foliage, but the right price, grab it, as long as theres still some green and its not diseased. Once you get your bargains home, give them a thorough drink. Set them in a tray or saucer to catch the water that pours through the potting mix and let them take their time soaking it up. Then proceed as if they were the healthiest plants in the world. Lower temperatures and shorter days mean plants need less water, but if rain is scarce, water weekly until the soil freezes. When the soil freezes hard, spread a few inches of mulch around your perennials, not to prevent the soil from freezing but to keep it from thawing. Roots that arent solidly anchored can frost heave out of the soil when the ground freezes and thaws, putting the plant in danger of getting killed by cold. Once mulch is on, youre all set. Even if a few of your new perennials dont make it, youre probably still coming out ahead. There are so many reasons to get out and garden  take your pick. Your garden will love it!

No matter what you call it, it is wrong and has consequences, perhaps not to the uncaught wrongdoer but certainly for their victims. Being on the receiving end of feedback for these events I can tell you that these acts have had impacts in a number of ways. That Angel stolen from someones lawn was in memory of a loved one and its removal devastated a young child, the squirrel removed from another property has been in that family for a very long time and can no longer be passed along, the flipped port -o- johns cost money to upright and that loser act of putting feces in the pool resulted in a lot of people not being able to enjoy a swim on what was probably one of the hottest days in the summer while preventing four people from going to work for the day. If you get a chance discuss these examples of how a night of fun can affect others and while you are at it, take the opportunity to share some warnings with your children about some real consequences. I am not talking about being carted away by the police. It could be meeting up with someone who will hurt or do worse to your darling. It would probably also be a good idea to really know who your kids are allowing into the Community because dear members, you are responsible for your guests and your childs friend is your guest.

David and his parents enjoyed another weekend at Special Olympics in New Jersey. He won gold and silver in 25 and 50 meters. Pike County and CLCA vs. Mothra BY J EANNE C ALABRESE Unlike the Mothra portrayed in films as a giant insect that lives on a tropical island and worshipped by local tribal people, the gypsy moth is no such diety. On the contrary gypsy moth caterpillars are despised. They destroy foliage on selected trees, especially varieties such as oak, birch, aspen and willow all of which are here in our Community. While trees may survive one or two years of such attacks, they generally do not survive beyond that. There were spotty reports of damage occurring in early spring in Conashaugh, but compared to some of our neighbors to the North, we were very fortunate. It is Pike Countys plan to have a spray suppression program in 2016. It is a request based program only. This means those wishing to be included must apply for this consideration. To qualify for the program properties must possess 250 egg masses per acre along with the trees favored by the moths. The Pike County Conservation District held a very informative seminar regarding these pests. Board MemberEnvironmental Liaison Bill King and I attended the seminar held at the Pike County Communications Center in August and learned about this caterpillars history, life cycle and procedures to be taken to be considered for the program. Our application was submitted immediately for the 2016 Program and was the first one received by PCCD following the seminar. The next step to take place will be an official count by PCCD of egg masses in our Community. They will also be determining spray blocks. All of these steps do not guarantee our participation in the program. First and foremost, the State needs to inform the County what if any funds will be allocated for the program and that has not been determined as of this writing. There are 17 counties including Pike that have applied for funds. Costs for spraying in 2015 ran between 26.00 and 27.00 per acre with cost sharing funds and 54.00 and 55.00 without cost sharing. It is expected these prices will increase for 2016. At this point we have done our part to get on board the moth suppression train and anxiously await further information regarding whether or not we qualify, if there is in fact going to be a suppression program and if so, how much it will cost the Community. Information regarding the product sprayed BT is available at the office. We will keep you posted on developments and moth news as we receive it. You can find helpful information on the Pike County Conservation District Website at http:www.pikeconservation. orggypsymoth.htm.

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20152016 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting always takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 26th. This year it will be held at the St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Despite folk lore and tales of insanity past, the meetings of the last several years have gone smoothly albeit are lightly attended. Refreshments will be served. Approximately one month before the meeting all members are mailed a ballot. Owners are permitted one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail or in person. If you are returning your ballot by mail, it is important that you use the provided envelope addressed to our Accountants, Beck, Gogolski and Poska. Please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed by us as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office.",

As President of the CLCA board of Directors, I can assure you that the members of the Board are strong advocates for the interests of our Community Members. We work hard to represent your interest by working with Office staff to see that everything done is for the benefit of all members, both young and old. The Board of Directors and the staff in the Office are always concerned that all we do is for your benefit and no one elses. This year we have again accomplished road paving with one dirt road paved and several others updated to maintain their condition as they age. We intend to pave another dirt road next year. Maintaining the roads that are already paved are a priority. This year we were able to pave more length of road using a tar and chip application. This method is less expensive than traditional paving and allows for the life of a road to be extended. It wont allow the time between re-paving to be as long as the previous methods. It should help in allowing us to pave all or a portion of a dirt road each year. Paving all or a portion of a dirt road is my goal. Many ask how it is decided which dirt road will be paved. Several factors go into deciding this such as the number of developed properties on a road, length of the road, traffic use for the road, cost to maintain the unpaved road and last but not least money available to do the paving. Also this year we were able to replace the Grader that was purchased in 1970 at a cost of 42,000. At a 3 inflation rate over the years the cost to replace it would have been 98,700.00. We were able to purchase a newer, used grader for  45,825 while receiving 22,000 for our trade in. Late this year the Ford F350 reached the end of its life and we have replaced it with a used Chevrolet Silverado. The F350 was purchased in 2006 at a cost of 68,000 wplow. We received 4,000 trade in against the cost of a Fleet Lease return vehicle for 49,000. All of the above purchases were accomplished using Reserve Money. Reserves accounts are funded by allocating money every year in the budget for Reserves There are two Reserve Accounts. One is for Roads and the other is General Reserves. Thank You CLIP  SAVE",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 4 Office Notes J EANNE C ALABRESE Summer did not delay her arrival this year. She gave spring the old heave ho with temperatures in May jumping from freezing to the 80s. Welcome to NEPA. Despite an early drought watch for our area we had a very wet June and first couple of weeks in July. Even with the rain work was accomplished. Roads were repaired and paved much earlier than in years past. Generally extensive road work took place in late August into September, but the Board of Directors wanted to get a jump on the work and take advantage of summer weather to allow leveling courses to cure before tar and chip was applied. Much has happened since the last issue of the Courier. Some of which you can read below. Mailbox Area In January the mailbox area sign was illuminated. It previously did not have an onoff switch and required manually pulling a plug each night. A timer was purchased and installed for illuminating the sign. The timer has a photocell allowing the sign to illuminate at dusk and remain on for six hours. The Maintenance department completed construction and installation of a bulletin board as well as extending the ground area surrounding that and the recycle bins. Roads As mentioned in the Presidents message, previously unpaved Gwinnett Road was fully paved. In addition tar and chip applications were done to Cree, Cayuga, Pine Grove and a section of Seneca. Maintenance repaired and applied new materials to unpaved roads including lower Overbrook, Junco, White Tail and Water Lily and performed maintenance on other non-paved roads. This might seem a little early and you may be sitting poolside reading this now but within a couple of months may be into the throes of an early snowfall. Please be aware that we do not have a bare road policy when it comes to snow removal. During minor snow events we sometimes receive inquiries as to why maintenance is not out plowing. Please understand that plows are not out immediately when snow starts to fly. Sometimes snow fall can last for a majority of the day however just over an inch accumulates. Anti skid applied during other snow and rain events can still be evident through the new snow. Due to the cost of materials combined with the fact that the snow amounts do not require plowing, only sides of the main and other paved roads may be cut back leaving the anti skid in the center. Social media experts reporting on various other sites make it difficult at times. People reporting horrible conditions for various roadshighwayscommunities stirs up readers and other commentators when sometimes no such conditions exist. Some feel they need to see the pavement for roads to be satisfactory. A lack of traffic combined with low temperatures can prevent roads from baring down to pavement even on the most sunny day. Unlike PennDot we do not have waves of people sitting in the wings waiting to tag team the next shift. Our workers come in at all times, even Holidays, even after having worked a whole day earlier and do a great job with keeping our roads as safe as possible. For the record, we dont pre-treat roads in our Community. We actually use very little salt on the roads a one to three ratio with anti-skid. It often amazes me when I see and hear comments about salting the roads. With wells and waterways why would we want to do that? The salt has to go somewhere when it runs off the road. It is also quite expensive and when temperatures get below certain points is useless. Dues All dues payment plans need to be paid up by August 28th. Gate cards are deactivated monthly for non- payment of dues. If the account continues in this status the mailbox is locked down and then the account is referred to collections. Security Sargent Sara Gabell and Officer Aaron Duckett resgined from United American Security in early January. Sara to pursue another career and Aaron to attend college.

In-house training was also offered to UAS Staff. The alarm panel in the office which was over ten years old failed. Our alarm Company, Vector installed a new panel which was covered by our maintenance contract with them. Fire Damaged Homes One of two fire damaged homes on Seneca was demolished. The second of the homes remains standing but was boarded in July after multiple requests followed by a demand and threat to take legal action by our Attorney. The property was originally going to be fenced at the request of the owners attorney but it was boarded instead. It has been reported that the insurance company and estate for the remaining home is in settlement negotiations and the home will be eventually demolished. Electric In an effort to reduce energy costs the Board approved an offer by Inspire Energy in February for generation charges. Since there has been inconsistent feedback regarding different energy companies, it was decided to test the offer for lower costs by using this company on only one of our nine meters. As of this date there has not been a remarkable difference noted in the cost for the meter. We are not bound in a contract to continue using this company and will monitor further before deciding to change back or turnover additional accounts. Volunteer Thanks Member Laura Elaro started a Poke Mon club in February which met on Wednesdays during the school year. Laura is also a Girl Scout Leader in our Community as are members Pam Wood and Debbie Boulanger. Thanks for all you do! Member Elena Luyando is always there with her camera, capturing photos for us to share. Thank you Elena for your contributions and for your important work with the Boy Scouts. Thank you to Lynn and John McCauley who also dedicate their time volunteering with the Scouts. Thank you to Jessica Olcott and Barbara Hamilton along with Kristen Kelleher for getting the Easter Bunny to our Annual Easter Egg Hunt. Members of the community were treated on the last day of school. Brian and Barbara Hamilton were on hand to dish out ice cream at the Rec Building. Special thanks to Regina Knight, Neil Johnson, Larry Farnum, Joe Kistle, Mike Stevenson, Fred Kline and Josef Lalor for their part with helping at the Dumpster Day held in May. Fishing Day was held May 5th and it was probably one of the most beautiful weather days we have had for this event. Volunteers Neil Johnson, Eddie Calabrese, Larry Farnum, Joe Kistle and Victor Perez who are there each year along with others were once again there helping to bait hooks, remove fish and untangle lines. As of this writing, planning is under way for the CLCA Annual Picnic scheduled to be held on Saturday August 22nd. Thank you to chairpersons Michael Bulger and Lynn McCauley who along with a number of other members in the Community worked hard planning and preparing for this event. Last but certainly not least, thank you to our Board Members for their work! Tax Sales For the May Judicial Sale there were a total of seven properties in Conashaugh listed for tax sale. Not surprising but all of these lots also have delinquent dues. Currently there are eleven CLCA properties in Repository. For information regarding tax sales in Pike County go to http: www.pikepa.orgtax.html. Trash and Recycling There has been a sharp decline in folks leaving garbage on the ground at the compactor along with no reported incidents of folks using the recycling bins as their personal dumpsters for several months now. Some other good trash related news is that the Board approved continuing the second pick up of recycling beyond Labor Day. Recycling does have an impact on the costs for trash removal. We ask all of our members to please recycle. New signs were installed on the compactor doors which should be very clear about what not to put in the compactor and the consequences for leaving trash. Dumpster day was held May 2nd. Four dumpsters used, three were for general trash, one was for metal. Delivery cost 3 dumpsters was 225.00 each. Cost per ton for contents 75.00. Fall 2015 Dumpster Day is scheduled to take place Saturday, October 17th. A total of 11.13 tons of trash was collected excluding metal during Spring 2015 Dumpster Day. Pennsylvania Child Protection Laws Amended Following a heads up by one of our members, we were notified by the Board of Health regarding requirements for anyone over the age of 14 whose job involves regular contact with children. Pool employees were required to obtain multiple clearances in order to work under this amendment. The law change also affected requirements for volunteers in the State who have regular contact with children. Rules Reminders  Dogs must be kept from roaming-do not allow your dog to run at large-  Permits are required to be obtained before removing any tree in excess of 1 inch  Permits andor approval from CLCA is needed for sheds, decks, extensions, roof replacement, exterior siding  painting. This is only a partial list of improvements requiring permits. Depending on what type of work you are completing you may also need a town permit. If you have any questions, please contact the office.  Do not leave trash on the ground if the compactor is closed or full. Please be sure your guests andor children are aware of this rule if they are taking out your trash.  Leaves and other yard debris are not permitted in the compactors.  Vehicles that area not registeredinspected road worthy are not to be stored on members properties. It is also a violation of Dingman Township Ordinance. Information regarding violations and fines associated with them can be found in your CLCA Blue Book. If you do not have one, please contact the office for a replacement.

Those who are experiencing financial difficulties or are in need of socialization are invited free of charge to dinner served between 2:00-4:00. Members of the Knights cook and serve the meal restaurant-style to those attending. A full course menu and dessert are provided. The menus vary each month such as roast beef, turkey, ham, Italian and Spanish. All are welcome. Anyone planning to attend is asked to call the parish office Mon., Thurs, Fri. 775-0681 or Bob DElia at 775- 9826 on Tuesday and Wednesday. We have many new residents with children in the Community who will be using the bus stop for the first time. For those of you who are new here, our school bus lot is located in front of the CLCA Office. Last year there were a total of five buses; two high school, one middle school and two elementaryprimary. We do not have a bus total for this year as of this writing. Bus schedules are mailed by the Delaware Valley School District. It is very important to leave enough time to arrive at least five minutes before your scheduled bus. This planning is especially important in winter weather. Dont wait until the last minute to leave to only find your windshield covered in ice. Take time to clean ice off your windshield properly. Driving with a plate sized port hole for a window is unsafe at best. Please stop at stop signs and do not speed. Children should be in seat belts and not hanging out of windows or a sunroof. You hopefully wouldnt drive down Route 739 or 84 with kids hanging out all over or sitting in your lap; why oh why would you take a chance and do it in the Community. Accidents can and do happen here. The impact of an airbag can kill or maim your child. Reminders for Bus Lot  Do not park, drop off or pick up students outside the bus lot. It is not safe for children or adults to be crossing exit or entrance lanes of the main entrance.  Parking lot lanes are one way, please follow signage  Parking lot speed limit is 5 mph  Follow directions if and when given by Security or Bus Monitors  The bus gate exit is for buses only- no cars are to use this exit  Once a departing bus starts moving, do not attempt to stop or block it - 500 fine. Bus drivers are not stopping for late arrivals  Procedures for the ElementaryPrimary School AFTERNOON PICK UPS ONLY- These buses will park in the travel lane located directly behind the front Conashaugh sign instead of the bus depot to discharge students. Vehicles are not permitted to moveleave the lot while these buses are present. If you arrive after the buses have entered the lot you are permitted to park in the bus depot area. Do not wait in or troll the aisles and do not pull up behind buses. Vehicles that have arrived lateparked in the bus depot will likely be the last to leave the lot. Plan accordingly. The first days of school are exciting for parents and kids alike and there typically are more cars than normal during those days especially for the ElementaryPrimary buses. There will likely be a number of folks new to the bus stop experience. Please be kind and understanding to others and if you see someone who appears to be confused or unfamiliar with procedures, give them a hand. For your information, the phone number for the director of Transportation for DVSD is 570-296-1883. Welcome to Conashaugh Lakes! A Happy welcome to the Hofmann family who arrived to our Community in June. Daniel and Jacqueline along with their children Daniel Jr., Alyssa, Alexa and Eliana are from North Massapequa, New York and will be living here full time.",

In addition, some funds were used from our Capital Improvement Account to transform our latest road from unpaved to paved. CLCA uses funds from a number of accounts to accomplish everything from major purchases to day to day operations. Those accounts include Operating Accounts, General Reserves, Road Reserves and Capital Improvement. We are fortunate to have Reserves Accounts as there are a number of associations that do not have any or only a small amount in Reserve. This I discovered as a member of AOCA. AOCA is an acronym for Alliance of Community Associations. The Alliance was started several years ago by our past President John Crerand. The purpose of this group is to share knowledge of various laws and techniques for accomplishing various tasks associated with being a community. Over the years much has been learned by presentations given by various invited speakers. We also share experiences as Community leaders. It is a place where we do our best to help each other with current issues as well as hurdles that may lay in the future. The cost of running an Association is costly and the success of doing so relies on our members paying their dues. I have been working with our dedicated office staff in pursuing those who choose to ignore their responsibility. Many dont realize that their property deed spells this obligation out. You cant plow streets, maintain roads, trim and cut grass, maintain the pool, keep the beach clean and drainage ditches clear, repair facilities, plus the many other things that need doing without funds to do them. In addition to the expense of labor there is the ever increasing cost of doing business. To mention a few which all of you also have is the cost of electricity, fuel, telephones, office equipment and supplies, maintenance of equipment, repair of broken gates and willful damage to property of the association. So in closing I would like for all of you to emphasize on any and all contacts that you make at the pool, mailbox, recycle, trash, how important it is that everyone pays their share of the expense of running this Association. Having said all that, I would like to take this opportunity to ask that you approve this years proposed budget with its modest 1 increase. A copy of the proposed budget can be found in this publication. Thank You Last Day of School Ice Cream Event!",

I have been on the CLCA Board of Directors for three years and am now running for a second term. I am the Board Liaison for the Maintenance Committee. I have also volunteered working CLCA Dumpster Days and Fishing Club events. I am a retired police detective with 28 years experience in police work. My wife Rose and I have been married for 58 years, have 3 children and 9 grandchildren. I am a 1955 graduate of Franklin High School, Franklin, New Jersey. After graduating I ventured into the work field and after many years of hard work, I became the owneroperator of a very successful business, Kistle Heating Service. After twenty-five years of owning a business, I decided it was time for a change. We moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where I started my career in police work at the El Paso County Sheriff s Department as a Deputy Sheriff. I was a Deputy Sheriff for 3 12 years before moving back to New Jersey due to a family illness. Upon returning to New Jersey, I continued my career in police work as a patrolman with the Ogdensburg Police Department, Ogdensburg, New Jersey, for 7 years. I then went to the Franklin Police Department, Franklin, New Jersey, as a patrolman for 10 years and was promoted to the position of Detective Sergeant which I held for 8 years until my retirement. My interests include hunting, fishing, baseball, softball, golf and football. I played on numerous teams for many years including playing seven years semi-pro football with the Atlantic Coast League. I remain very interested in the affairs of the Community and would like to continue as a member of the Board. Sincerely, Joseph L. Kistle CLCA ELECTIONS Joseph L. Kistle B ILL K ING In 2014, I semi-retired and moved full time to Conashaugh Lakes with my wife, Karen. We love the wild life and serenity of the community. I grew up on the tide waters of the Chesapeake Bay in southern Marylands farm country, fishing, crabbing, hunting and farming. As a teenager I spent summers working on a tobacco farm during the day while catching and selling crabs early in the morning. I worked my way through college as an auto parts clerk and graduated from the University of Maryland with a BS in Accounting. Shortly after college I joined Motorola where I spent the next 27 years. Leaving Motorola in 2006 I subsequently worked for two other companies based out of New York City, Brookwood Companies Incorporated and The New York Leadership Center, Inc. Employment has kept my wife and I moving around. Beginning with my home state of Maryland, we have also lived in Chicago, Dallas, south Florida, northern New Jersey, and New York City. We hope to settle here in Conasaugh Lakes. The biggest lesson learned over the years is to treat all people fairly, transparently, and truthfully. We have two sons and a grandson and attend Milford Bible Church. Bill King Thanks For Your Generosity Conashaugh has been the beneficiary of a number of generous donations of materials and useable objects in recent months. Thank you Robert Kurlyck for your donation of a nice outdoor table for the picnic area. Members Fidel and Reggie Iglesias donated a number of lounge chairs for the pool area and chairs for the office.

Kids and teens, instead of bringing home bottles and bags from pool IN THEIR BAGS, leave on roadside--very disgusting AND they DO NOT volunteer for clean-ups! Fast food soda glasses tossed from cars--so disgusting, especially when dumpster is open until 10:00 P.M.! CLCA has more than enough garbage around. This practice of litter is total LAZINESS  in my opinion, reflects badly more on the kids than the adults! The occasional bag off the top of a car is just that--occasional; but the other litter reflects on the young people! Cigarette butts are EXTREMELY toxic to very young children. The colors, brown nicotine, yellow filter,  either yellow specks or white paper filters intrigue children ages 9 months-4 years. As they pull them apart and of course put them in their mouth, the carcinogens can harm OUR children. PLEASE, do not toss butts from car windows; lots of families use our roadways for walks. Thanks for listening to MY MAIN GRIPES Sincerely, Lynn McCauley M ICHAEL B ULGER My name is Michael Bulger and I am running for the board. I have lived in Conashaugh for nine years and have served on the board as the communitys treasurer from my second year here through my seventh. I was required to take two years off after serving six, so now Im running to go back on. As treasurer I tried to spend the communitys money as carefully as I would my own, holding any increases in dues to an average of about 1 a year while I was doing it. I was part of the subcommittee that created our roads fund which has been repaving roads the last few years, and I fought against putting us into debt by spending seven figures to build a new poolclubhouse that we didnt need. Instead we spent less than a tenth of that to re-side our current pool and that should last literally for decades to come. I have also co-hosted our annual picnic in the past and am doing so again this year. Elect me and I promise to look out for the community in the same way I did for the six years that I was on the board previously. Thanks. Michael Bulger CONASHAUGH NEWS",

Coming soon to Conashaugh at the picnic area will be our own Bocce court regulation size. I dont have an exact date but I hope by our Annual Picnic. My name is Lenny Maruca and I will be the first Bocce Captain setting up teams. How this works is every Monday for ten weeks at 3:00 p.m. two teams two people each will play against each other. After that the best two teams will have playoff. There will be regulation Bocce balls that you will use. This is just an outline. Once we know how many teams we have, more information you will receive. Some Bocce Facts: Bocce Italian: A ball sport belonging to the boules sport family, closely related to bowls and pentaque, with a common ancestry from ancient games played in the Roman Empire. Developed into its present form in Italy. Bocce was initially played among Italian migrants but has slowly become more popular with their descendants and a wider community. Bocce is traditionally played on natural sil and asphalt courts 27.5 meters90 ft. in length and 2.5 to 4 meters 8.2 to 13.1 ft. wide. Bocce balls can be made of metal or various kinds of plastic. Unlike Lawn bowls, bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias. A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the jack called a Boccino or Pallino in some areas, from one end of the court into a zone five meters16 ft in length ending 2.5 meters 8.2 ft. from the far end of the court If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone. The side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does not have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that are closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically 7 to 13 points. Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately. Anyone can play no matter what your age as long as you can hold the Bocce balls and understand the rules of the game. If you are interested in playing Bocce, please send me an email with the number of teams from your household. My email is lenjosverizon.net. Please indicate Bocce in the subject of the email.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2015 PAGE 15 LATE SUMMER  EARLY FALL GARDENING OUTDOOR  RECREATION Fall has distinct planting benefits. Pesky pests, especially mosquitoes, retreat due to cooler temperatures. You dont need to fertilize since it promotes new growth that can be nipped in winter. This is the prime time to prepare your yard for the next growing season. Septembers cooler air temperatures are easier on both plants and gardeners. Many perennials have a head start when planted in the autumn. Its the perfect time to get outside and transplant trees and shrubs and divide some of those spring and summer blooming perennials. The soil still retains warmth from the summers heat encouraging root growth until the ground freezes which is often weeks or even months after the first frost hits. Frost might seem like your biggest fall planting challenge, but actually its not a huge problem. Yes, frost will kill the tops of your new plants but it wont affect the root growth. Want free plants for your garden? Look for fat, plump seed pods. As they mature they swell up, stop growing and start turning brownish  thats the key sign to look for in most cases. Collect seeds by shaking them inside a paper envelope. Some of the easiest perennial flowers to collect seeds from include: Black-eyed Susan, Cone flower, Meadow rue, Obedient plant, Perennial Sunflower, Perennial sweet pea, Veronica. Once youre done collecting, write the name of the plant seed on the envelope and put it some place you wont forget. A shoe box makes a fine file cabinet for all those envelopes. If collecting and storing seeds is not for you, the late summer is usually bargain time as garden centers are trying to sell the last of their inventory before winter. At the end of the season, you can find discounts on plants that have passed their peak. Most nurseries knock down prices when their perennials go out of bloom and lower them even more when the plants start looking down and out. Expect to find perennials at 50 percent or more off. You know that section in the bargain area thats super cheap and its not hard to tell why. I call it death row, and its actually where I head first in the hopes of finding a steal. The plants often look pitiful, but some are still worth a shot. If its wilted, generally sad looking or has yellowing or dying foliage, but the right price, grab it, as long as theres still some green and its not diseased. Once you get your bargains home, give them a thorough drink. Set them in a tray or saucer to catch the water that pours through the potting mix and let them take their time soaking it up. Then proceed as if they were the healthiest plants in the world. Lower temperatures and shorter days mean plants need less water, but if rain is scarce, water weekly until the soil freezes. When the soil freezes hard, spread a few inches of mulch around your perennials, not to prevent the soil from freezing but to keep it from thawing. Roots that arent solidly anchored can frost heave out of the soil when the ground freezes and thaws, putting the plant in danger of getting killed by cold. Once mulch is on, youre all set. Even if a few of your new perennials dont make it, youre probably still coming out ahead. There are so many reasons to get out and garden  take your pick. Your garden will love it!

This activity includes but is not limited to decorations being removed from peoples properties, port o johns being flipped over, poop being thrown into the swimming pool. I could go on. Some will say it is out of boredom, others say it is a lack of respect and some may say its because theres nothing else for kids to do. Some may think it is funny, others say disgusting. No matter what you call it, it is wrong and has consequences, perhaps not to the uncaught wrongdoer but certainly for their victims. Being on the receiving end of feedback for these events I can tell you that these acts have had impacts in a number of ways. That Angel stolen from someones lawn was in memory of a loved one and its removal devastated a young child, the squirrel removed from another property has been in that family for a very long time and can no longer be passed along, the flipped port -o- johns cost money to upright and that loser act of putting feces in the pool resulted in a lot of people not being able to enjoy a swim on what was probably one of the hottest days in the summer while preventing four people from going to work for the day. If you get a chance discuss these examples of how a night of fun can affect others and while you are at it, take the opportunity to share some warnings with your children about some real consequences. I am not talking about being carted away by the police. It could be meeting up with someone who will hurt or do worse to your darling. It would probably also be a good idea to really know who your kids are allowing into the Community because dear members, you are responsible for your guests and your childs friend is your guest.

He won gold and silver in 25 and 50 meters. Pike County and CLCA vs. Mothra BY J EANNE C ALABRESE Unlike the Mothra portrayed in films as a giant insect that lives on a tropical island and worshipped by local tribal people, the gypsy moth is no such diety. On the contrary gypsy moth caterpillars are despised. They destroy foliage on selected trees, especially varieties such as oak, birch, aspen and willow all of which are here in our Community. While trees may survive one or two years of such attacks, they generally do not survive beyond that. There were spotty reports of damage occurring in early spring in Conashaugh, but compared to some of our neighbors to the North, we were very fortunate. It is Pike Countys plan to have a spray suppression program in 2016. It is a request based program only. This means those wishing to be included must apply for this consideration. To qualify for the program properties must possess 250 egg masses per acre along with the trees favored by the moths. The Pike County Conservation District held a very informative seminar regarding these pests. Board MemberEnvironmental Liaison Bill King and I attended the seminar held at the Pike County Communications Center in August and learned about this caterpillars history, life cycle and procedures to be taken to be considered for the program. Our application was submitted immediately for the 2016 Program and was the first one received by PCCD following the seminar. The next step to take place will be an official count by PCCD of egg masses in our Community. They will also be determining spray blocks. All of these steps do not guarantee our participation in the program. First and foremost, the State needs to inform the County what if any funds will be allocated for the program and that has not been determined as of this writing. There are 17 counties including Pike that have applied for funds. Costs for spraying in 2015 ran between 26.00 and 27.00 per acre with cost sharing funds and 54.00 and 55.00 without cost sharing. It is expected these prices will increase for 2016. At this point we have done our part to get on board the moth suppression train and anxiously await further information regarding whether or not we qualify, if there is in fact going to be a suppression program and if so, how much it will cost the Community. Information regarding the product sprayed BT is available at the office. We will keep you posted on developments and moth news as we receive it. You can find helpful information on the Pike County Conservation District Website at http:www.pikeconservation. orggypsymoth.htm.",

We share our members concerns regarding this and while missing mail is a U.S.P.S. matter, we have been trying our best to reconnect members with their lost items. We ask that our members help with this effort by doing the following: 1. It is very important that if you have any concerns regarding the delivery of your mail or packages that you express this concern with the Milford Post Master, Juan Calle. His phone number is 570-296-7411. 2. Please pick up your mail regularly and go through it as soon as possible. If you get something that is not yours, please do not hold onto it. There are outgoing mailboxes in each mailbox cluster where incorrectly delivered mail can be placed. Please do not put it in the blue US Mail box. It will go on a journey somewhere in Lehigh Valley only to come back this way again. 3. Please do not write, no such personreturn to sender on items that are correctly addressed but placed in the wrong recipients box. The address and person probably do exist, however, the mail was delivered to the wrong mailbox. 4. Please do not leave incorrectly delivered mail on top of the mailboxes. It can blow away or become damaged from the elements or taken. 5. If you receive a package that is not yours, please do not just leave it in the parcel box. Parcel boxes are unsecured once opened. During business hours, please bring parcels to the office. We understand that its the Post Offices job to ensure delivery and not the people living here, but it is the neighborly Flea Market Success!

Important Information, Please Read BY J EANNE C ALABRESE Winter is past the halfway mark and it is time to remind everyone that road bans are imminent. This may be old news to some of our members. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVWgross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans can be expected in March and April this year. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes. Please feel free to call the office if you do not have access to the internet. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non- emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they didnt know. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation. Important Reminders Regarding Snow Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicles at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible to for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe. United American Security Phone Numbers Guard House at Front Entrance 570-686-1130 Guard on Duty at CLCA 800-682-4722 When paging please advise the operator that you are calling to have the officer on duty located and provide the location where the officer is needed i.e., your home, compactor or other location. Always call 911 in an emergency! CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2015 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION From The Office J EANNE C ALABRESE Hal Borland wrote No Winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn. Good words to live by if you are not a fan of Jack Frost. We had an early start with a heavy snowfall on Thanksgiving Eve, Unfortunately in exchange for snow in January we have had quite a bit of ice which proved treacherous for driving and walking. Ice was also taxing on our maintenance staff and snow and ice material supplies. Thankfully there has been a relief in gas prices, with costs the lowest in more than five years. This is especially helpful since taxes on fuel increased. With spring almost on the horizon, please keep a watchful eye for road bans in our Community. There is a separate article on this subject on page 3. The following are some events, happenings and projects that have taken place since our Annual Courier. August: Maintenance removed pavement areas at the main and member entrance areas and installed new loops for the gates. Wayco paved both areas. Project cost 52,227.39. this project was paid from the Capital Improvement Fund. Installation of a new well to service the Maintenance and Pool yards was completed. The new well is 500 feet deep and was installed by Knight Drilling. CLCA Maintenance dug trenches for new wiring and lines for the well, reducing costs. Project cost: 9707.12. Payment for this project was made from the Capital Improvement Fund. We were informed that the appeal filed by CLCA and Sunrise Lakes Community Associations with regard to Airline FuelJo-Jo Oils planned transfer station on Route 739 was rejected in the Supreme Court. There havent been any further developments reported regarding plans for the property. It was learned however, that Airline Fuel is no longer in the propane business and that Keystone Fuel purchased that part of the company. Maintenance completed removal of dead trees from woods surrounding mailbox area. Thank you to Reggie Iglesias, the Recreation Committee and all of the volunteers who worked on the Annual Picnic. Musical entertainment for the picnic was provided and donated by Conashaughs very own Paul Renstrom and Denise Hunters band. Members in our Community were very generous donating food, bedding, coats and other needs for the Pike County Humane Society during a drive held in the CLCA Office. Twelve members were contacted regarding delinquent 20132014 dues and informed that referral to Sunrise Credit was imminent. Seven of the twelve members produced payment and the remaining five accounts were sent to collections. Thank you to our members who make paying dues a priority. Dues are essential to the health and ongoing operations in our Community. September: Nerves were on edge in our area this month and throughout October while the Pennsylvania State Police and Law Enforcement Agencies from across the country searched for Eric Frein. For those not familiar with the events surrounding this search, Mr. Frein is suspected of ambushing two State Police Officers outside their barracks in Blooming Grove on the evening of September 12. He was located and apprehended on October 30th. Thank you to our members who generously donated supplies to help sustain those agencies through a collection by Laura Elaros Girl Scout Troop 52-735 at Conashaugh and other collection sites in Pike County. The Annual Meeting was held at the St.Vincent dePaul Parish Hall on September 27th where the 20142015 proposed budget passed by a majority vote of 83 yes to 36 nay. 4 Members abstained. Candidates Reggie Iglesias and Josef Lalor were elected to the CLCA Board of Directors. A speed bump was purchased to replace one stolen from Oneida Way in August. Y es, that would be stolen, skillfully removed along with the nine bolts holding it to the road and the warning signage. The new speed bump will be installed for springsummer 2015. Maintenance installed a pole and lighting in the bus lot. Cost for materials totaled 652.06. Maintenance did all labor. A previous estimate to install lighting was obtained from an electrical contractor for 2,000 plus with our maintenance employees digging trenches and installing footings. Pike County Tax Claim held an Upset Sale on September 24th. A total of 27 properties in our Community were listed for the sale that included 6 developedhouses properties, 1 partially developedunder construction property and 20 undeveloped lots. The six developed and one partially developed lots along with five undeveloped properties were removed prior to the saletaxes paid. There were no bids made on the remaining 15 undeveloped properties.

Prior to that project our maintenance department removed five aging culvert pipes and replaced pipes where needed. The project area stretched from the intersection of Overbrook Run to Bartlett Drive. Project cost 198,834.10. Payment for this project was made from the Road Reserve Fund. October: The deteriorating Maintenance yard fence was replaced by American Fence. The original wooden fence had been in place for numerous years. Maintenance dismantled the old fence and salvaged wood where possible. Additional sets of gates were installed with the new fencing to allow for removal of snow within the maintenance yard and safer entry and exit for maintenance vehicles. The total cost for the project was 10,700.00. Payment for this project was made from the Capital Improvement Fund. Treesmiths Company hired by Met-Ed completed clearing of branches and dead trees away from power lines in the Community. Fall Dumpster Day was held October 4th. Four, thirty yard containers were used for the collection. 9.42 tons of trash were collected. The total bill for dumpster day was 1381.50 and the total amount of fees collected was 1225.00. Thank you to our Maintenance Crew who along with volunteers Neil Johnson, Joe Kistle, Fred Kline and Josef Lalor, spent a very soggy day unloading vehicles in the maintenance yard. The recycle bins were relocated within in the mailbox area to a more discreet location. A number of comments were received regarding the appearance of the bins where they were previously located. The new location along with fencing blinds the view of the bins from vehicles driving into the community. The fence was constructed by Maintenance from wood salvaged during the demo of the old maintenance yard fence. Trunk or Treat was held by Seneca Lake. Thank you Recreation Committee Chairperson Jessica Olcott for organizing this event and to all of the participants who participated including members of the Dingman Township Fire Department. November Two homes in the Community were damaged by fire. See article page 11. Not something we like to do but, continued inaction to address unpaid dues resulted in three residents losing mailbox privileges. The members made no attempt to contact us regarding repeated requests to do so and left no alternative. On that note, unless you have nothing else better to do with 500.00, lending your addressmailbox to anyone who has lost this amenity is not recommended. It is a violation. A second hearing took place in Magistrate Coopers court in the matter of CLCA vs. Person Who Thought it Was a Good Idea to Deliberately Break Member Gate. The lovely defendant failed to show and a decision including fines and restitution was rendered. On a more palatable subject, member Ginger Jones held a two night class where she shared her expertise and soup recipes. Attendees reported enjoying the event and getting to meet others in the Community. Thanks Ginger! December Thank you to Jessica Olcott and Barbara Hamilton for doing a beautiful job with the CLCA Family Christmas Party. There were a number of very happy faces at the event held at the St. Vincent dePaul Parish Hall. Activities included craft stations and a visit by the ever delightful Santa Claus. Member Ginger Jones did a lovely job chairing an Adult Christmas Party at the Rec Building. Ginger and husband Jim prepared wonderful appetizers and refreshments. For something different, ornaments were exchanged between attendees. Congratulations to the winners of this years Holiday Home Decorating Contest. The following homes took the top three prize: 195 Oneida, 188 Conashaugh Trail and 104 Hart Court. On the Horizon Do you need to rid your home or property of some items? As you wait and search for the first signs of spring, start your inventory of items to either dispose of at Dumpster Daywatch for date or sell at the CLCA Annual Memorial WeekendSat  Sun Flea Market. Members are also free to post items for sale or to give away on Conashaughs Facebook Page and the LOOP. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2015 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION New CLCA Bulletin Board on the Way The CLCA Bulletin Board previously at the Compactor was removed during the Maintenance Yard fence project. The rolling style and location of the new gate prevented safe reinstallation of the old board in its original location. A new bulletin Board will be mounted in the Mailbox area. Dave designed the board to compliment the Pizza Board housing. He along with the Maintenance Crew are constructing it as a winterindoor project. The location for the new board is as traveledused as the compactor area. Benefits include less lingering in the trash area which can become congested just from trash traffic during peak periods. Postings on the new board will be required to be dated to allow removal after 30 days.

Thank you The first fire occurred November 3rd and was discovered at approximately 10:00 a.m. by a member driving by 157 Seneca en route to the compactor. Smoke was observed pouring through the roof. The second fire occurred in a neighboring home at 151 Seneca on November 11th. The report of that fire came to Maintenance Foreman Dave Altemier who responded to the scene immediately. The approximate time of discovery was 8:00 a.m. Although Seneca is typically busy with traffic at that time of day, November 11 was a school holiday. Things got tense during the second fire when embers and arching power lines fell to the ground igniting leaves. Maintenance personnel using hand held extinguishers kept the ground fires from spreading towards properties on Cayuga Trail. While firefighters fought the building flames. Both fires were investigated by the PSP Fire Marshall. Thank you to the volunteers from companies in Hemlock Farms, Dingman Township, Blooming Grove and Milford who responded to these fires.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2015 PAGE 15 WINTER GARDENING The winter garden generally needs less care, as nature seems to go to sleep with the arrival of the season. Cold days. Dark nights. Its easy to go into hibernation. This is a good time to start thinking, planning and designing your dream garden. Cuddle up in your favorite chair next to the fireplace and peruse those garden catalogs or go online early for the best selections. There are quite a few things to look after in order to preserve your gardens health and prepare it for the spring. Here are a few things from indoor projects to planning for the spring season you can do to ward off cabin fever: Start indoor seeds of annuals that have slow growth lobelia, petunia, vinca, snapdragon, verbena and pansies. You can purchase these later from your local gardening center, but it is much cheaper to grow yourself and you can try unusual varieties that may not be available locally. Prune away storm-damage branches promptly to prevent tearing of the bark and further damage to trees and shrubs. Prune narrow leafed evergreens to improve shape and clean out winter damaged branches such as yews, junipers and arborvitae. While youre out there, force a winter bouquet from cut branches of forsythia, pussy willow, wisteria or lilac. Bruise the cut ends and set them in water. Spray the branches frequently, keep in a cool place until they bloom and then move to a warmer area for display. Re-invigorate your houseplants by removing a 12 inch of soil and top-dressing with fresh potting soil. Spider mites are apt to thrive in warm, dry houses. Frequent misting under the leaves will discourage them. Keep in mind that houseplants will be sensitive to overfeeding at this time of the year. Provide lots of sunlight, and frequent bathing for plants that seem a little worse for the winter. Dont forget to rotate houseplants so they get even sun and growth. Begin to prune these plants regularly in March by pinching back new growth. Resist the temptation to uncover spring-flowering plants. Mulch may be loosened, but the shoots will still benefit from protection against cold, drying winds. Remove mulch in stages once night time temperatures rise into the 30s. Pull off some of the mulch, leaving some material behind. A week or so later, pull back the rest, but dont remove it from the area. Leaving it close by the plants will allow you to easily cover them if a late cold snap hits. Mulch removal should be done on a cloudy day. This will allow any early growth to become acclimated to brighter conditions gradually  if you remove the mulch on a clear day, the plants could be scalded by the sudden bright sun light. With spring just around the corner, the fickle March weather makes it impossible to set exact dates and schedules for gardening, so proceed with caution! Happy gardening from the Ladybug Food Drive Black Bears werent the only ones looking for food this fall. Our Bear Cub Pack conducted their Annual Scouting for Food Drive in November. Thank you to our CLCA residents who supported this drive. Youre the best! Friendly Reminders Please follow all traffic flow signs for the mailbox and school bus parking lot. These are both one way travel areas. All vehicles must remain parked while the afternoon Elementary and Primary buses are present in the parking lot. The parking lot is not a playground.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2015 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Heads Up! Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read BY J EANNE C ALABRESE Winter is past the halfway mark and it is time to remind everyone that road bans are imminent. This may be old news to some of our members. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVWgross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans can be expected in March and April this year. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes. Please feel free to call the office if you do not have access to the internet. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non- emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they didnt know. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation. Important Reminders Regarding Snow Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicles at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible to for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe. United American Security Phone Numbers Guard House at Front Entrance 570-686-1130 Guard on Duty at CLCA 800-682-4722 When paging please advise the operator that you are calling to have the officer on duty located and provide the location where the officer is needed i.e., your home, compactor or other location.

Good words to live by if you are not a fan of Jack Frost. We had an early start with a heavy snowfall on Thanksgiving Eve, Unfortunately in exchange for snow in January we have had quite a bit of ice which proved treacherous for driving and walking. Ice was also taxing on our maintenance staff and snow and ice material supplies. Thankfully there has been a relief in gas prices, with costs the lowest in more than five years. This is especially helpful since taxes on fuel increased. With spring almost on the horizon, please keep a watchful eye for road bans in our Community. There is a separate article on this subject on page 3. The following are some events, happenings and projects that have taken place since our Annual Courier. August: Maintenance removed pavement areas at the main and member entrance areas and installed new loops for the gates. Wayco paved both areas. Project cost 52,227.39. this project was paid from the Capital Improvement Fund. Installation of a new well to service the Maintenance and Pool yards was completed. The new well is 500 feet deep and was installed by Knight Drilling. CLCA Maintenance dug trenches for new wiring and lines for the well, reducing costs. Project cost: 9707.12. Payment for this project was made from the Capital Improvement Fund. We were informed that the appeal filed by CLCA and Sunrise Lakes Community Associations with regard to Airline FuelJo-Jo Oils planned transfer station on Route 739 was rejected in the Supreme Court. There havent been any further developments reported regarding plans for the property. It was learned however, that Airline Fuel is no longer in the propane business and that Keystone Fuel purchased that part of the company. Maintenance completed removal of dead trees from woods surrounding mailbox area. Thank you to Reggie Iglesias, the Recreation Committee and all of the volunteers who worked on the Annual Picnic. Musical entertainment for the picnic was provided and donated by Conashaughs very own Paul Renstrom and Denise Hunters band. Members in our Community were very generous donating food, bedding, coats and other needs for the Pike County Humane Society during a drive held in the CLCA Office. Twelve members were contacted regarding delinquent 20132014 dues and informed that referral to Sunrise Credit was imminent. Seven of the twelve members produced payment and the remaining five accounts were sent to collections. Thank you to our members who make paying dues a priority. Dues are essential to the health and ongoing operations in our Community. September: Nerves were on edge in our area this month and throughout October while the Pennsylvania State Police and Law Enforcement Agencies from across the country searched for Eric Frein. For those not familiar with the events surrounding this search, Mr. Frein is suspected of ambushing two State Police Officers outside their barracks in Blooming Grove on the evening of September 12. He was located and apprehended on October 30th. Thank you to our members who generously donated supplies to help sustain those agencies through a collection by Laura Elaros Girl Scout Troop 52-735 at Conashaugh and other collection sites in Pike County. The Annual Meeting was held at the St.Vincent dePaul Parish Hall on September 27th where the 20142015 proposed budget passed by a majority vote of 83 yes to 36 nay. 4 Members abstained. Candidates Reggie Iglesias and Josef Lalor were elected to the CLCA Board of Directors. A speed bump was purchased to replace one stolen from Oneida Way in August. Y es, that would be stolen, skillfully removed along with the nine bolts holding it to the road and the warning signage. The new speed bump will be installed for springsummer 2015. Maintenance installed a pole and lighting in the bus lot. Cost for materials totaled 652.06. Maintenance did all labor. A previous estimate to install lighting was obtained from an electrical contractor for 2,000 plus with our maintenance employees digging trenches and installing footings. Pike County Tax Claim held an Upset Sale on September 24th. A total of 27 properties in our Community were listed for the sale that included 6 developedhouses properties, 1 partially developedunder construction property and 20 undeveloped lots. The six developed and one partially developed lots along with five undeveloped properties were removed prior to the saletaxes paid. There were no bids made on the remaining 15 undeveloped properties.

Prior to that project our maintenance department removed five aging culvert pipes and replaced pipes where needed. The project area stretched from the intersection of Overbrook Run to Bartlett Drive. Project cost 198,834.10. Payment for this project was made from the Road Reserve Fund. October: The deteriorating Maintenance yard fence was replaced by American Fence. The original wooden fence had been in place for numerous years. Maintenance dismantled the old fence and salvaged wood where possible. Additional sets of gates were installed with the new fencing to allow for removal of snow within the maintenance yard and safer entry and exit for maintenance vehicles. The total cost for the project was 10,700.00. Payment for this project was made from the Capital Improvement Fund. Treesmiths Company hired by Met-Ed completed clearing of branches and dead trees away from power lines in the Community. Fall Dumpster Day was held October 4th. Four, thirty yard containers were used for the collection. 9.42 tons of trash were collected. The total bill for dumpster day was 1381.50 and the total amount of fees collected was 1225.00. Thank you to our Maintenance Crew who along with volunteers Neil Johnson, Joe Kistle, Fred Kline and Josef Lalor, spent a very soggy day unloading vehicles in the maintenance yard. The recycle bins were relocated within in the mailbox area to a more discreet location. A number of comments were received regarding the appearance of the bins where they were previously located. The new location along with fencing blinds the view of the bins from vehicles driving into the community. The fence was constructed by Maintenance from wood salvaged during the demo of the old maintenance yard fence. Trunk or Treat was held by Seneca Lake. Thank you Recreation Committee Chairperson Jessica Olcott for organizing this event and to all of the participants who participated including members of the Dingman Township Fire Department. November Two homes in the Community were damaged by fire. See article page 11. Not something we like to do but, continued inaction to address unpaid dues resulted in three residents losing mailbox privileges. The members made no attempt to contact us regarding repeated requests to do so and left no alternative. On that note, unless you have nothing else better to do with 500.00, lending your addressmailbox to anyone who has lost this amenity is not recommended. It is a violation. A second hearing took place in Magistrate Coopers court in the matter of CLCA vs. Person Who Thought it Was a Good Idea to Deliberately Break Member Gate. The lovely defendant failed to show and a decision including fines and restitution was rendered. On a more palatable subject, member Ginger Jones held a two night class where she shared her expertise and soup recipes. Attendees reported enjoying the event and getting to meet others in the Community. Thanks Ginger! December Thank you to Jessica Olcott and Barbara Hamilton for doing a beautiful job with the CLCA Family Christmas Party. There were a number of very happy faces at the event held at the St. Vincent dePaul Parish Hall. Activities included craft stations and a visit by the ever delightful Santa Claus. Member Ginger Jones did a lovely job chairing an Adult Christmas Party at the Rec Building. Ginger and husband Jim prepared wonderful appetizers and refreshments. For something different, ornaments were exchanged between attendees. Congratulations to the winners of this years Holiday Home Decorating Contest. The following homes took the top three prize: 195 Oneida, 188 Conashaugh Trail and 104 Hart Court. On the Horizon Do you need to rid your home or property of some items? As you wait and search for the first signs of spring, start your inventory of items to either dispose of at Dumpster Daywatch for date or sell at the CLCA Annual Memorial WeekendSat  Sun Flea Market.

Dave designed the board to compliment the Pizza Board housing. He along with the Maintenance Crew are constructing it as a winterindoor project.

Thank you The first fire occurred November 3rd and was discovered at approximately 10:00 a.m. by a member driving by 157 Seneca en route to the compactor. Smoke was observed pouring through the roof. The second fire occurred in a neighboring home at 151 Seneca on November 11th. The report of that fire came to Maintenance Foreman Dave Altemier who responded to the scene immediately. The approximate time of discovery was 8:00 a.m. Although Seneca is typically busy with traffic at that time of day, November 11 was a school holiday. Things got tense during the second fire when embers and arching power lines fell to the ground igniting leaves. Maintenance personnel using hand held extinguishers kept the ground fires from spreading towards properties on Cayuga Trail. While firefighters fought the building flames. Both fires were investigated by the PSP Fire Marshall. Thank you to the volunteers from companies in Hemlock Farms, Dingman Township, Blooming Grove and Milford who responded to these fires.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2015 PAGE 15 WINTER GARDENING The winter garden generally needs less care, as nature seems to go to sleep with the arrival of the season. Cold days. Dark nights. Its easy to go into hibernation. This is a good time to start thinking, planning and designing your dream garden. Cuddle up in your favorite chair next to the fireplace and peruse those garden catalogs or go online early for the best selections. There are quite a few things to look after in order to preserve your gardens health and prepare it for the spring. Here are a few things from indoor projects to planning for the spring season you can do to ward off cabin fever: Start indoor seeds of annuals that have slow growth lobelia, petunia, vinca, snapdragon, verbena and pansies. You can purchase these later from your local gardening center, but it is much cheaper to grow yourself and you can try unusual varieties that may not be available locally. Prune away storm-damage branches promptly to prevent tearing of the bark and further damage to trees and shrubs. Prune narrow leafed evergreens to improve shape and clean out winter damaged branches such as yews, junipers and arborvitae. While youre out there, force a winter bouquet from cut branches of forsythia, pussy willow, wisteria or lilac. Bruise the cut ends and set them in water. Spray the branches frequently, keep in a cool place until they bloom and then move to a warmer area for display. Re-invigorate your houseplants by removing a 12 inch of soil and top-dressing with fresh potting soil. Spider mites are apt to thrive in warm, dry houses. Frequent misting under the leaves will discourage them. Keep in mind that houseplants will be sensitive to overfeeding at this time of the year. Provide lots of sunlight, and frequent bathing for plants that seem a little worse for the winter. Dont forget to rotate houseplants so they get even sun and growth. Begin to prune these plants regularly in March by pinching back new growth. Resist the temptation to uncover spring-flowering plants. Mulch may be loosened, but the shoots will still benefit from protection against cold, drying winds. Remove mulch in stages once night time temperatures rise into the 30s. Pull off some of the mulch, leaving some material behind. A week or so later, pull back the rest, but dont remove it from the area. Leaving it close by the plants will allow you to easily cover them if a late cold snap hits. Mulch removal should be done on a cloudy day. This will allow any early growth to become acclimated to brighter conditions gradually  if you remove the mulch on a clear day, the plants could be scalded by the sudden bright sun light. With spring just around the corner, the fickle March weather makes it impossible to set exact dates and schedules for gardening, so proceed with caution! Happy gardening from the Ladybug Food Drive Black Bears werent the only ones looking for food this fall. Our Bear Cub Pack conducted their Annual Scouting for Food Drive in November. Thank you to our CLCA residents who supported this drive. Youre the best! Friendly Reminders Please follow all traffic flow signs for the mailbox and school bus parking lot. These are both one way travel areas. All vehicles must remain parked while the afternoon Elementary and Primary buses are present in the parking lot. The parking lot is not a playground. Please do not allow children to play there, before or after school. Thank you OUTDOOR  RECREATION",

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20162017 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting always takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 24th. The meeting will be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Refreshments will be served. All members are mailed a ballot to vote. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, please contact the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa- versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed by as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office.

There were a number of wild fires too close for comfort this past spring. Burn bans were issued in the Community as well as Pike County. When a burn ban is issued, no outdoor burning is permitted regardless of whether it is in a barrel or fire pit. Burn bans are announced via the LOOP and Facebook. Bans are also posted on the lighted board in the mailbox area and on signage at the compactor and Community entrances. When it is safe to burn it should be in an approved location on your property and the fire needs to be properly contained. Burning of leaves or other yard waste on the ground is not permitted and a recipe for disaster. Permits for burning are available at no cost from the CLCA Office. It is a one time permit with directions to follow for placement of your burn barrelpit and directions to follow when burning. The Dingman Fire Department website provides burn ban status and directions to follow when burning. The website address is http:www.dingmanfire.comBurning20Ban.htm. Regardless of whether or not a burn ban is in effect it is very important to check conditions before burning on your property. Is there very dry vegetation or windy conditions? If so, dont burn. Keep a hose nearby and dont leave your fire unattended. If you are using a barrel make sure it is entirely made of metal. It should have at least three evenly spaced screened vents on the side and a metal top screen. Be considerate of your neighbors when burning especially during months when windows may be open. Not many folks are fond of their home smelling like a campsite. People in rural areas are known to burn trash for various reasons such as avoiding to have to pay for trash removal, no existence of waste removal services or long hauls to a dump. While burning of household trash may be widespread in those areas, it is totally unnecessary in our Community. It is also illegal. Conashaugh rules as well as Dingman Township Ordinance prohibits the burning of trash. Residents have more than ample accessibility to receptacles to dispose of household trash and recyclables. The burning of trash, especially plastics are dangerous to the environment and people. Please dont do it. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2016 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Attention Members With Dues Payment Plans Final payments for 20152016 payment plans are due by August 28th. Thank you to all of our members who paid their dues. The CLCA 20152016 fiscal year ends September 30 2016. CLCA Bus Stop We have many new residents with children in the Community who will be using the bus stop for the first time. For those of you who are new to our Community, our school bus lot is located in front of the CLCA Office. As of last year there were five buses; two high school, one middle school and two elementaryprimary. Bus schedules and assignments are mailed by the Delaware Valley School District to your home. It is very important to leave enough time to arrive at least five minutes before your scheduled bus arrival. This planning is especially important in winter weather. Dont wait until the last minute to leave to only find your windshield covered in ice. Take time to clean your windshield properly. Driving in the Community does not provide immunity to accidents. The same traffic rules apply here as they would on public roads. Please stop at stop signs and do not speed. Children should be in seat belts and not hanging out of windows or a sunroof. You hopefully wouldnt drive down Route 739 or 84 with kids hanging out all over or sitting in your lap; why oh why would you take a chance and do it in the Community. Reminders for Bus Time -Do not park, drop off or pick up students outside the bus lot. It is not safe for children or adults to be crossing exit or entrance lanes of the main entrance. This includes late bus pick up time. Please park in the lot. Your children will not collapse walking the extra few feet. Vehicles blocking the main entrance waiting for buses creates a hazard for those trying to exit 739.  Parking lot lanes are one way, please follow signage  Parking lot speed limit is 5mph  Follow directions when given by Security or Bus Monitors  The bus gate exit is for buses only- no cars are to use this exit  Once a departing bus starts moving, do not attempt to stop or block it - 500.00 fine. Bus drivers are not stopping for late arrivals -Procedures for the ElementaryPrimary School AFTERNOON PICK UPS ONLY- These buses will park in the travel lane located directly behind the front Conashaugh sign instead of the bus depot to discharge students. Vehicles are not permitted to moveleave the lot while these buses are present. If you arrive after the buses have entered the lot you are permitted to park in the bus depot area. Do not wait in or troll the aisles and do not pull up behind buses. Vehicles that have arrived late parked in the bus depot will likely be the last to leave the lot. Plan accordingly. If you need special arrangements to depart for an appointment arrive a little early and visit the office for assistance. Our bathroom is also available for your use if needed. The first days of school are exciting for parents and kids alike and there typically are more cars than normal during those days especially for the ElementaryPrimary buses. There will be a lot of members new to the bus stop experience. Please be kind and understanding to others and if you see someone who appears to be confused or unfamiliar with procedures, give them a hand. For your information, the phone number for the director of Transportation for DVSD is 570-296-1883. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2016 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION Office Notes J EANNE C ALABRESE By the time you read this summers flowers will have begun to fade and children will be headed back to school. It has been a quiet summer thus far in our Community with the exception of a few antics. The following is a peek of happenings in the Community since the start of our current Conashaugh year. Properties Resale packets for the sale of properties were issued as follows by month:  October: 5 for sale by owner, 2 foreclosures  November: 2 foreclosures  December: 1 for sale by owner  January: 1 for sale by owner, 1 short sale, 1 foreclosure  February: 1 for sale by owner, 2 foreclosures  March: 1 lot for sale by owner, 1 foreclosure  April: 0 issued  May: 1 lot for sale by owner  June: 1 for sale by owner  July: 5 for sale by owner Tax Sales An upset sale was held by Pike County Tax Claim on September 23. There were 24 CLCA properties listed for tax sale of which 6 were removed prior to the sale taxes or a portion paid by owner. Of the remaining eighteen properties, one sold. The new owner paid 2979.72 in delinquent taxes plus costs. Since liens do not fall off properties sold at Upset sales, the owner paid Conashaugh 5253.61 for delinquent dues and other charges owed on the lot. The next scheduled upset sale is set for September 21, 2016. Currently there are 24 properties listed for CLCA. For additional information visit www. pikepa.orgtaxclaim. Plow for 2012 Chevy A new plow was purchased and installed October 2, 2015. The total cost was 7461.53 tax included. A 2 discount was provided by the seller. Tree Removed A very large, dead tree located on CLCA owned property at the intersection of Iroquois and Flatbrook was removed in November. The tree began shedding large sheets of bark and dead branches. Due to its proximity to wires it was necessary to hire a contractor. Four companies were contacted. Wood was left for members to take and disappeared within 24 hours. Cost for removal was 500.00 which for the size and location of the tree was extremely reasonable. Rec Building  Office The Board approved shopping for estimates to explore repairing the exterior of the Rec Building. A scope of the desired work was prepared and the search for contractors for bids began. Five contractors have conducted inspections and one has submitted an estimate as of this writing. Bids are also being secured to repair the deck at the front office. Compactor Project Preliminary work began in October with an informal visit with Dingman Township personnel to develop a plan for this project and obtain paperwork needed for permits. Conashaugh Lakes is requesting approval for the following lots to be combined: Lot 901-A, Lot 904, Lot 905, Lot 906 The existing use for lot 901-A is the Conashaugh Lakes Community Office, Bus Stop, Security Building, Mailbox and Recycling Area. Lots 904, 905 and 906 are undeveloped lots owned by Conashaugh Lakes. The planned use for the combined lots is to relocate our existing compactor trash collection area and recycling to one location. On April 13th Dave and I attended a meeting with the Dingman Township engineer to go over planning of this project. Following the meeting we returned to the surveyor for an updated drawing to include proposed area set up and placement of compactors and recycle bins. It was also suggested to contact Pike County Conservation to address what if any permits that might be needed from them. Unfortunately my personal life over the past few months has allowed for little to no time or opportunity to leave the community for business or otherwise. Work on the project has resumed and visits with the needed agencies will take place in September. Updates will be shared via the LOOP and Facebook. Signs At the suggestion of the Rules and Regulation and Security Committees, a number of different signs were requested and installed including Pick Up After Your Dogfor the front lake, Children Playing Seneca between pool and Overbrook, Lake for Use by Residents Onlyfront lake and a stop sign at the intersection of Cree and Seneca. No tailgating signs were installed at both gates. Security Diana Lang, previously a manager for Triple A Security, Vector and United American retired in November. Brenda Kellogg Kinzer was named as Dianas replacement and is our contactliaison for UAS. Following a recommendation by the Security Committee employees of United American began parking the Security and personal vehicles in a more discreet location. Summer hours were adjusted for added, longer night patrols. Board Appointment Following the September 2015 Annual Meeting there was a vacancy on the Board of Directors. Member Brian Hamilton a member of the Security and Rules and Regulations Committees was appointed to fill the vacancy. Brian is currently running for the Board and his bio can be viewed elsewhere in this publication. Secretary Reggie Iglesias tendered her resignation to the Board of Directors in August. Thank you Reggie for your work as a Board Member. Larry Farnum a current candidate for the Board of Directors was appointed to fill vacancy left by Reggie. Collections: Seventeen accounts were referred to collections for nonpayment of dues. Roads Crack Sealing Wayco was in the community sealing cracks on Oneida from pool to Iroquois on Tues Nov 24 and Weds. Nov 25 Middleton, Rodney, Denege and Geronimo have all been transformed from unpaved to newly paved roads. Additional maintenance paving was done on Flatbrook, Lenape and Mohican. Whipple and Walton roadways along with an area in the ball field parking lot were damaged by vehicles doing donuts and speeding. Although there was a rash of this type of activity in early summer, it has diminished. Maintenance began widening Walton Way which is currently an unpaved road. Flatbrook Way Dam In November 2015 work began through our engineer Pennoni to address The Department of Environmental Protections requirement to register the Flatbrook Way Dam. Criteria set by the DEP defined the area as qualifying as a dam subject to registration and possible annual fees. After many months of conversation, an inspection and providing paperwork the DEP a issued a waiver 570.296.9200 CALL NOW!

Always call 911 in an emergency! CLIP  SAVE regarding registration of the dam. Nevertheless no work can be done at the dam without permits and approval from the DEP. As you may or may not recall, the DEP began charging private dam owners annual fees a couple of years ago. We currently pay the DEP 800.00 annually for Conashaugh Lake Dam. Additionally, the DEP was requiring that all private dam owners pay escrow money for the purpose of breaching their dam should it become necessary if a community were to go bankrupt. Thanks to efforts by Representative Rosemary Brown an alternative approach to fund a general account vs. high cost escrow for dam owners is being addressed through legislation. HB 1712 Established a Private Dam Financial Assurance Program Fund, Passed in the House and waiting for senate approval. 2016 Pike County Moth Suppression Program: Findings by the Pike County Conservation District revealed that CLCA did not have the required number of healthy egg masses. The state requires there to be a minimum of 250 healthy egg masses per acre to be eligible for the spray program. This was good news as there were zero funds coming from the state to subsidize spraying. Gates Our security company was contacted to see if there is any additional equipment i.e. electric eyes that can be installed to have gates close. There is not. There are two ways in which the gate closure is operated. 1. by loops only; once vehicle passes the gate comes down which presents a problem if vehicles have a trailer. The Loop may not pick up the tongue between trailer and vehicle and either come down between the two or on top of the trailerwhatever is being towed. 2.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2016 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION Dumpster Day Spring 2016 It just keeps coming and coming and coming. Theres never a let up. Its relentless. For those of you who are Seinfeld fans, this wasnt a mail reference, but the thoughts of workers, who spent hours unloading trash and filling forty yard dumpsters at the Maintenance Yard for Dumpster Day that was held May 7th. The vehicles just kept coming and coming but thanks to our Maintenance Staff and a host of volunteers, approximately twenty tons of trash was collected and taken away. This was a large increase compared to last years spring collection which yielded slightly over eleven tons of trash. Special thanks to our volunteers including Scott Bailey, Larry Farnum, Brian Hamilton, Neil Johnson, Joe Kistle, Fred Kline, David Weed and our Maintenance Staff for their hard work with making this day a success. Voter Registration Election time is just around the corner! The deadline to register to vote in PA for the November 8, 2016 election is October 11, 2016. You can register on the following website: https:www.pavoterservices.state.pa.uspages VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx The Pike County Board of Elections Office is located in the County Administration Building at 506 Broad Street, Milford.

While there are two polling locations for Dingman Township, Conashaugh residents typically vote at the Dingman Township Volunteer Fire Department located on Log Tavern Road. Simple Math  If you do not pay your cell bill, it is turned off.  If you do not pay your electric bill, it is turned off.  If you do not pay your cable bill, it is turned off.  If you do not pay your childs music, sports club, dance lessons bill, they dont get to participate.  If you do not pay your Master Card bill, you cant use it. Why then is there sometimes surprise, anger even attitude when someone fails to pay dues, makes no attempt to contact the office, and consequently has amenities removed andor the account sent to collections or litigation? ATT, Blue Ridge and local business owners cant operate for free and neither can Conashaugh Lakes. Dues are very important to the daily operation and overall health of our Community. Thankfully a majority of our members pay their dues and only a small percentage fall short. Thank you to all of our members who make this a priority. Welcome to Conashaugh Lakes!

I flew seven years in CorporateCharter aviation followed by 29 years as pilot for a major US airline. Some things that keep me busy are my interests in shooting sports, fishing, auto mechanics, home repair and maintenance. Since moving to Conashaugh Lakes, I have been active with the Security and Rules and Regulations Committees. My wife Barbara has been active with the Recreation, Rules and Regulations and Communications Committees. Last year I was appointed to fill a one year vacancy on the Board of Directors. I am running for a full three year term on the Board. I have been fortunate and honored this past year to serve and learn alongside the other members of our Board of Directors, who hold nothing but the best interests of our community at the forefront. Having served as a member of the Board for the past year, I now feel I have the foundation to serve a full term. Conashaugh Lakes is a great community and the longer my wife and I live here, the more we love it. There are always issues and improvements to be made and I hope to have the opportunity to be a part of the continued success of our community as a member of the Board of Directors.

I am a past Board Member and held positions as President, Vice President and Director over six years following an appointment. At this time I am ending a two year waiting period as per the by-laws. I thoroughly believe that the success of a Community relies on volunteerism and continued serving CLCA as a volunteer on the Finance and Security Committees. My past volunteerism involved participating in a number of Community activities including Halloween and gate patrol, the CLCA Annual Picnic, Dumpster Day as well as the Recreation and Maintenance Committees. As President I took a proactive hands-on approach in handling matters including an aggressive negotiation of our contract with Waste Management which resulted in substantial savings for the Community. If elected to serve on the Board of Directors, I will resume working to the best of my ability to keep our Community running efficiently and in a continued forward direction. Thank you.

We have our very own published author! Kimberly Garnick-Giarratano. Kimberly is not just a writer, but a winner. Her book Dead and Breakfast is the winner of a coveted Kindle Scout contract. In 2015 her book Grunge Gods and Graveyards, won the Killer Nashville Silver Falchion Award for Best Young Adult Category. She is an author of several paranormal books targeted for the young adult audience. Graveyards are her thing, Kimberly tells me that she loves them. What would attract someone to a place that many of us fear? You will be surprised. Very romantic and sentimental reasons have drawn her to cemeteries and ghosts in her lifetime. Knowing that Kimberly was drawn to the dark side in her writing, I was a little apprehensive about interviewing her. We agreed to meet at her home. My mind wandered for the weeks before we actually met I had heard we had an author in our community who wrote about graveyards and some of our fellow Conashaugh Lakers had led me to believe that she was one scary lady! When I got to her home I was greeted by two beautiful children, a very happy dog and a wonderful, smiling young woman who introduced herself to me as, Kimberly, the author. Her home was decorated - as a home - no demonic art work, no bones and cobwebs hanging from ceilings, no coffins in the backyard or the bedroom. Just a very warm, welcoming home filled with completely and totally normal things. The sentimental part that began her relationship with graveyards started as a young girl. Her Grandmother and her shared some very special There Is An Author Amongst Us!!! B Y V ALERIE F ERLAUTO time visiting lost relatives and friends at a cemetery close to her home. Her Grandmother would tell her about their lives and explained some of the traditions that her family held close, like the placing of stones on gravestones. Kimberly felt a connection to these people and the quiet calmness of the cemetery and she loved to be spooked. The romantic side came from a classic book and movie, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. The book was written in 1945, movie in 1947 and television show 1968. This is a love story between a widow, Mrs. Muir and the ghost of Sea Captain Daniel Gregg. They were very much in love, however, they could not be together until Mrs. Muir dies. Kimberly found this to be eerily romantic and the concept of ghosts fascinated her. She was inspired to write her own stories that would be sentimental, romantic and deadly...or at least include graveyards! Kimberly has been writing since she was a young girl growing up in Manalapan, New Jersey. As a college student at The College of New Jersey, she was the Editor of the school paper. Although she dedicated a forty hour week to this non paying status, she considers it to be one of her best experiences for writing. After college she worked as an English teacher as a Second Language teacher while she completed two Masters. One in Education and the second at Rutgers University in Library Science. She left teaching to become a Young Adult Librarian in Rockaway, New Jersey. She felt that the library was overlooking this age group and she worked hard to create an incredible program that was dedicated to attracting young people to the library. She was very successful in this endeavor. Love did enter her life. She married Bob for more than one reason - however when I asked about him the first thing that she told me is that he is an amazing chef, preparing chopped liver and Latkes for her. He also seems to be very cooperative about vacationing to places with graveyards. During one of her pregnancies she finally sat down to write, what would become her first published book in 2011. Grunge Gods and Graveyards is set in 1996, a time frame that Kimberly feels close to. The book includes locations right here in Pike County! Very exciting, read it and see if you recognize any of these places. This book is the first in her The Grunge God Series, it was followed by the novella The Lady in Blue. Dead and Breakfast, part of her The Cayo Hueso Mystery Series, was inspired by her love of a graveyard she visited in Key West, Florida. This book is filled with mystery , history, ghost whisperers and, of course, a graveyard! Short stories are a great way to enjoy an evening... especially when the lights go out...Kimberly has a few for you, One Night is all You Need and Brave New Girls - Tales of Girls and Gadgets. Kimberly is currently working on a passion project - a slight diversion from graveyards and ghosts. There are many trials and tribulations to getting a book published and Kimberly should be writing her next book advising new authors on how to handle this. Her advice to future writers, take creative writing courses. My advice to you, get to one of our local Libraries, Amazon or Kindle and start reading her books!

Theres nothing to do at this point but enjoy it, right? Of course not. Gardens may move more slowly in August and immediate gardening tasks, like watering and weeding, may be all you think you really need to do. Its a stand and watch month, time to keep your senses alert for weeds that need to be pulled, pests that need to be stopped, and plants that need care. Tip: A natural repellent to slugs, snails, ants and other creepy-crawly bugs is coffee grounds! They cant stand the acidity of coffee. Sprinkling the soil a few inches from the base of plants will keep these pests away. Tip: Recipe for a natural weed killer: 1 gallon of white vinegar, 1 cup table salt, 1 tablespoon liquid dish detergent funnel into a plastic spray bottle. Drench the weeds on a dry sunny day. Weeds soaked with this solution die within several days. They wont be back and nothing else will ever grow there. Flower beds? By this point in the summer, some annuals may have become spindly or leggy. It is a good time to pinch or trim them back by as much as half their current height. They will soon begin to leaf out, look thicker and start to bloom again. Dead head flowers to keep the blooms coming. Continue to remove faded blooms on annuals such as geraniums, marigolds, petunias, salvia, verbena and zinnias. Even the most reliable summer bloomers stage a stronger show when you faithfully remove faded flowers. As the fall season approaches, some of the annuals begin to feel the effects of their age and the weather. When mums at local nurseries are available, pull out the annuals and move mums to fill in the vacancies. Geraniums? You dont have to wait until fall for root cuttings to bring indoors. Irises and poppies? Dig up and divide roots now. This is also a good time to prune shrubs and hedges as well as pine and fir trees. Water newly planted trees, shrubs, and perennials  any plants you added to your yard last fall or spring. These plants need weekly irrigation to ensure roots establish deeply. Take cuttings of plants you want to overwinter. Choices may include fuchsia, scented geranium, coleus, or wax begonia. Stick 3- to 4-inch green stem cuttings in soil. Place pots in a shaded spot, and keep soil moist. Ladybug is preparing for autumn and hopes you are too.

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20162017 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting always takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 24th. The meeting will be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Refreshments will be served. All members are mailed a ballot to vote. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, please contact the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa- versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed by as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office.",

There were a number of wild fires too close for comfort this past spring. Burn bans were issued in the Community as well as Pike County. When a burn ban is issued, no outdoor burning is permitted regardless of whether it is in a barrel or fire pit. Burn bans are announced via the LOOP and Facebook. Bans are also posted on the lighted board in the mailbox area and on signage at the compactor and Community entrances. When it is safe to burn it should be in an approved location on your property and the fire needs to be properly contained. Burning of leaves or other yard waste on the ground is not permitted and a recipe for disaster. Permits for burning are available at no cost from the CLCA Office. It is a one time permit with directions to follow for placement of your burn barrelpit and directions to follow when burning. The Dingman Fire Department website provides burn ban status and directions to follow when burning. The website address is http:www.dingmanfire.comBurning20Ban.htm. Regardless of whether or not a burn ban is in effect it is very important to check conditions before burning on your property. Is there very dry vegetation or windy conditions? If so, dont burn. Keep a hose nearby and dont leave your fire unattended. If you are using a barrel make sure it is entirely made of metal. It should have at least three evenly spaced screened vents on the side and a metal top screen. Be considerate of your neighbors when burning especially during months when windows may be open. Not many folks are fond of their home smelling like a campsite. People in rural areas are known to burn trash for various reasons such as avoiding to have to pay for trash removal, no existence of waste removal services or long hauls to a dump. While burning of household trash may be widespread in those areas, it is totally unnecessary in our Community. It is also illegal. Conashaugh rules as well as Dingman Township Ordinance prohibits the burning of trash. Residents have more than ample accessibility to receptacles to dispose of household trash and recyclables. The burning of trash, especially plastics are dangerous to the environment and people. Please dont do it.",

Thank you to all of our members who paid their dues. The CLCA 20152016 fiscal year ends September 30 2016. CLCA Bus Stop We have many new residents with children in the Community who will be using the bus stop for the first time. For those of you who are new to our Community, our school bus lot is located in front of the CLCA Office. As of last year there were five buses; two high school, one middle school and two elementaryprimary. Bus schedules and assignments are mailed by the Delaware Valley School District to your home. It is very important to leave enough time to arrive at least five minutes before your scheduled bus arrival. This planning is especially important in winter weather. Dont wait until the last minute to leave to only find your windshield covered in ice. Take time to clean your windshield properly. Driving in the Community does not provide immunity to accidents. The same traffic rules apply here as they would on public roads. Please stop at stop signs and do not speed. Children should be in seat belts and not hanging out of windows or a sunroof. You hopefully wouldnt drive down Route 739 or 84 with kids hanging out all over or sitting in your lap; why oh why would you take a chance and do it in the Community. Reminders for Bus Time -Do not park, drop off or pick up students outside the bus lot. It is not safe for children or adults to be crossing exit or entrance lanes of the main entrance. This includes late bus pick up time. Please park in the lot. Your children will not collapse walking the extra few feet. Vehicles blocking the main entrance waiting for buses creates a hazard for those trying to exit 739.  Parking lot lanes are one way, please follow signage  Parking lot speed limit is 5mph  Follow directions when given by Security or Bus Monitors  The bus gate exit is for buses only- no cars are to use this exit  Once a departing bus starts moving, do not attempt to stop or block it - 500.00 fine. Bus drivers are not stopping for late arrivals -Procedures for the ElementaryPrimary School AFTERNOON PICK UPS ONLY- These buses will park in the travel lane located directly behind the front Conashaugh sign instead of the bus depot to discharge students. Vehicles are not permitted to moveleave the lot while these buses are present. If you arrive after the buses have entered the lot you are permitted to park in the bus depot area. Do not wait in or troll the aisles and do not pull up behind buses. Vehicles that have arrived late parked in the bus depot will likely be the last to leave the lot. Plan accordingly. If you need special arrangements to depart for an appointment arrive a little early and visit the office for assistance. Our bathroom is also available for your use if needed. The first days of school are exciting for parents and kids alike and there typically are more cars than normal during those days especially for the ElementaryPrimary buses. There will be a lot of members new to the bus stop experience. Please be kind and understanding to others and if you see someone who appears to be confused or unfamiliar with procedures, give them a hand. For your information, the phone number for the director of Transportation for DVSD is 570-296-1883.",

It has been a quiet summer thus far in our Community with the exception of a few antics. The following is a peek of happenings in the Community since the start of our current Conashaugh year. Properties Resale packets for the sale of properties were issued as follows by month:  October: 5 for sale by owner, 2 foreclosures  November: 2 foreclosures  December: 1 for sale by owner  January: 1 for sale by owner, 1 short sale, 1 foreclosure  February: 1 for sale by owner, 2 foreclosures  March: 1 lot for sale by owner, 1 foreclosure  April: 0 issued  May: 1 lot for sale by owner  June: 1 for sale by owner  July: 5 for sale by owner Tax Sales An upset sale was held by Pike County Tax Claim on September 23. There were 24 CLCA properties listed for tax sale of which 6 were removed prior to the sale taxes or a portion paid by owner. Of the remaining eighteen properties, one sold. The new owner paid 2979.72 in delinquent taxes plus costs. Since liens do not fall off properties sold at Upset sales, the owner paid Conashaugh 5253.61 for delinquent dues and other charges owed on the lot. The next scheduled upset sale is set for September 21, 2016. Currently there are 24 properties listed for CLCA. For additional information visit www. pikepa.orgtaxclaim. Plow for 2012 Chevy A new plow was purchased and installed October 2, 2015. The total cost was 7461.53 tax included. A 2 discount was provided by the seller. Tree Removed A very large, dead tree located on CLCA owned property at the intersection of Iroquois and Flatbrook was removed in November. The tree began shedding large sheets of bark and dead branches. Due to its proximity to wires it was necessary to hire a contractor. Four companies were contacted. Wood was left for members to take and disappeared within 24 hours. Cost for removal was 500.00 which for the size and location of the tree was extremely reasonable. Rec Building  Office The Board approved shopping for estimates to explore repairing the exterior of the Rec Building. A scope of the desired work was prepared and the search for contractors for bids began. Five contractors have conducted inspections and one has submitted an estimate as of this writing. Bids are also being secured to repair the deck at the front office. Compactor Project Preliminary work began in October with an informal visit with Dingman Township personnel to develop a plan for this project and obtain paperwork needed for permits. Conashaugh Lakes is requesting approval for the following lots to be combined: Lot 901-A, Lot 904, Lot 905, Lot 906 The existing use for lot 901-A is the Conashaugh Lakes Community Office, Bus Stop, Security Building, Mailbox and Recycling Area. Lots 904, 905 and 906 are undeveloped lots owned by Conashaugh Lakes. The planned use for the combined lots is to relocate our existing compactor trash collection area and recycling to one location. On April 13th Dave and I attended a meeting with the Dingman Township engineer to go over planning of this project. Following the meeting we returned to the surveyor for an updated drawing to include proposed area set up and placement of compactors and recycle bins. It was also suggested to contact Pike County Conservation to address what if any permits that might be needed from them. Unfortunately my personal life over the past few months has allowed for little to no time or opportunity to leave the community for business or otherwise. Work on the project has resumed and visits with the needed agencies will take place in September. Updates will be shared via the LOOP and Facebook. Signs At the suggestion of the Rules and Regulation and Security Committees, a number of different signs were requested and installed including Pick Up After Your Dogfor the front lake, Children Playing Seneca between pool and Overbrook, Lake for Use by Residents Onlyfront lake and a stop sign at the intersection of Cree and Seneca. No tailgating signs were installed at both gates. Security Diana Lang, previously a manager for Triple A Security, Vector and United American retired in November. Brenda Kellogg Kinzer was named as Dianas replacement and is our contactliaison for UAS. Following a recommendation by the Security Committee employees of United American began parking the Security and personal vehicles in a more discreet location. Summer hours were adjusted for added, longer night patrols. Board Appointment Following the September 2015 Annual Meeting there was a vacancy on the Board of Directors. Member Brian Hamilton a member of the Security and Rules and Regulations Committees was appointed to fill the vacancy. Brian is currently running for the Board and his bio can be viewed elsewhere in this publication. Secretary Reggie Iglesias tendered her resignation to the Board of Directors in August. Thank you Reggie for your work as a Board Member. Larry Farnum a current candidate for the Board of Directors was appointed to fill vacancy left by Reggie. Collections: Seventeen accounts were referred to collections for nonpayment of dues. Roads Crack Sealing Wayco was in the community sealing cracks on Oneida from pool to Iroquois on Tues Nov 24 and Weds. Nov 25 Middleton, Rodney, Denege and Geronimo have all been transformed from unpaved to newly paved roads. Additional maintenance paving was done on Flatbrook, Lenape and Mohican. Whipple and Walton roadways along with an area in the ball field parking lot were damaged by vehicles doing donuts and speeding. Although there was a rash of this type of activity in early summer, it has diminished. Maintenance began widening Walton Way which is currently an unpaved road. Flatbrook Way Dam In November 2015 work began through our engineer Pennoni to address The Department of Environmental Protections requirement to register the Flatbrook Way Dam. Criteria set by the DEP defined the area as qualifying as a dam subject to registration and possible annual fees. After many months of conversation, an inspection and providing paperwork the DEP a issued a waiver 570.296.9200 CALL NOW!

Always call 911 in an emergency! CLIP  SAVE regarding registration of the dam. Nevertheless no work can be done at the dam without permits and approval from the DEP. As you may or may not recall, the DEP began charging private dam owners annual fees a couple of years ago. We currently pay the DEP 800.00 annually for Conashaugh Lake Dam. Additionally, the DEP was requiring that all private dam owners pay escrow money for the purpose of breaching their dam should it become necessary if a community were to go bankrupt. Thanks to efforts by Representative Rosemary Brown an alternative approach to fund a general account vs. high cost escrow for dam owners is being addressed through legislation. HB 1712 Established a Private Dam Financial Assurance Program Fund, Passed in the House and waiting for senate approval. 2016 Pike County Moth Suppression Program: Findings by the Pike County Conservation District revealed that CLCA did not have the required number of healthy egg masses. The state requires there to be a minimum of 250 healthy egg masses per acre to be eligible for the spray program. This was good news as there were zero funds coming from the state to subsidize spraying. Gates Our security company was contacted to see if there is any additional equipment i.e. electric eyes that can be installed to have gates close. There is not. There are two ways in which the gate closure is operated. 1. by loops only; once vehicle passes the gate comes down which presents a problem if vehicles have a trailer. The Loop may not pick up the tongue between trailer and vehicle and either come down between the two or on top of the trailerwhatever is being towed. 2. Timer with LOOP back up- drivers have a specific amount of time in which to proceed thru the gate. If they are too slow, gate will come down and they will have to either re-swipe or re-contact memberoffice to reopen the gate. Signs for the entrances were designed and ordered which include No Tailgating and 150.00 Fine. Do not allow your guests to tailgate your vehicle. Please use a gate card for each vehicle or call your guests in from your home or through the office during business hours. The gate update project is ongoing. Please be sure to notify the office of vehicle changes. As a reminder, gate cards are periodically monitored if a car not matching a card is used, the gate card may be deactivated until updated info is provided to the office. Cell Tower There has been no further response by Verizon regarding proposing a cell tower installation in the community. Maintenance Early spring like weather allowed Maintenance to get a jump on projects. Workers cleaned out and repaired ditch lines, the ballfield was groomed, trees removed, fencing repaired in the bus lot, and vehicle maintenance to name a few things.

For those of you who are Seinfeld fans, this wasnt a mail reference, but the thoughts of workers, who spent hours unloading trash and filling forty yard dumpsters at the Maintenance Yard for Dumpster Day that was held May 7th. The vehicles just kept coming and coming but thanks to our Maintenance Staff and a host of volunteers, approximately twenty tons of trash was collected and taken away. This was a large increase compared to last years spring collection which yielded slightly over eleven tons of trash. Special thanks to our volunteers including Scott Bailey, Larry Farnum, Brian Hamilton, Neil Johnson, Joe Kistle, Fred Kline, David Weed and our Maintenance Staff for their hard work with making this day a success. Voter Registration Election time is just around the corner! The deadline to register to vote in PA for the November 8, 2016 election is October 11, 2016. You can register on the following website: https:www.pavoterservices.state.pa.uspages VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx The Pike County Board of Elections Office is located in the County Administration Building at 506 Broad Street, Milford. Their website is https:www.pikepa.orgelections.html. You can find downloadable forms on the site for voter registration and absentee ballots. While there are two polling locations for Dingman Township, Conashaugh residents typically vote at the Dingman Township Volunteer Fire Department located on Log Tavern Road. Simple Math  If you do not pay your cell bill, it is turned off.  If you do not pay your electric bill, it is turned off.  If you do not pay your cable bill, it is turned off.  If you do not pay your childs music, sports club, dance lessons bill, they dont get to participate.  If you do not pay your Master Card bill, you cant use it. Why then is there sometimes surprise, anger even attitude when someone fails to pay dues, makes no attempt to contact the office, and consequently has amenities removed andor the account sent to collections or litigation? ATT, Blue Ridge and local business owners cant operate for free and neither can Conashaugh Lakes. Dues are very important to the daily operation and overall health of our Community. Thankfully a majority of our members pay their dues and only a small percentage fall short. Thank you to all of our members who make this a priority. Welcome to Conashaugh Lakes! A great big Conashaugh welcome to our newest full time residents. The Petty Family, Joe and Debbie along with their children Charlie and Ava arrived from Chicagoland this past June. Dawn Lombard and Andrew, Calder and Teagan Gee arrived from Connecticut in April. John and Deborah Henry moved to Conashaugh from West Milford, NJ in March. Best wishes in your new homes. May you enjoy good lives filled with peace, happiness and good friends and neighbors.",

I am a past Board Member and held positions as President, Vice President and Director over six years following an appointment. At this time I am ending a two year waiting period as per the by-laws. I thoroughly believe that the success of a Community relies on volunteerism and continued serving CLCA as a volunteer on the Finance and Security Committees. My past volunteerism involved participating in a number of Community activities including Halloween and gate patrol, the CLCA Annual Picnic, Dumpster Day as well as the Recreation and Maintenance Committees. As President I took a proactive hands-on approach in handling matters including an aggressive negotiation of our contract with Waste Management which resulted in substantial savings for the Community. If elected to serve on the Board of Directors, I will resume working to the best of my ability to keep our Community running efficiently and in a continued forward direction. Thank you.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2016 PAGE 12 CONASHAUGH NEWS Yes indeed, right here in beautiful Conashaugh Lakes. We have our very own published author! Kimberly Garnick-Giarratano. Kimberly is not just a writer, but a winner. Her book Dead and Breakfast is the winner of a coveted Kindle Scout contract. In 2015 her book Grunge Gods and Graveyards, won the Killer Nashville Silver Falchion Award for Best Young Adult Category. She is an author of several paranormal books targeted for the young adult audience. Graveyards are her thing, Kimberly tells me that she loves them. What would attract someone to a place that many of us fear? You will be surprised. Very romantic and sentimental reasons have drawn her to cemeteries and ghosts in her lifetime. Knowing that Kimberly was drawn to the dark side in her writing, I was a little apprehensive about interviewing her. We agreed to meet at her home. My mind wandered for the weeks before we actually met I had heard we had an author in our community who wrote about graveyards and some of our fellow Conashaugh Lakers had led me to believe that she was one scary lady! When I got to her home I was greeted by two beautiful children, a very happy dog and a wonderful, smiling young woman who introduced herself to me as, Kimberly, the author. Her home was decorated - as a home - no demonic art work, no bones and cobwebs hanging from ceilings, no coffins in the backyard or the bedroom. Just a very warm, welcoming home filled with completely and totally normal things. The sentimental part that began her relationship with graveyards started as a young girl. Her Grandmother and her shared some very special There Is An Author Amongst Us!!! B Y V ALERIE F ERLAUTO time visiting lost relatives and friends at a cemetery close to her home. Her Grandmother would tell her about their lives and explained some of the traditions that her family held close, like the placing of stones on gravestones. Kimberly felt a connection to these people and the quiet calmness of the cemetery and she loved to be spooked. The romantic side came from a classic book and movie, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. The book was written in 1945, movie in 1947 and television show 1968. This is a love story between a widow, Mrs. Muir and the ghost of Sea Captain Daniel Gregg. They were very much in love, however, they could not be together until Mrs. Muir dies. Kimberly found this to be eerily romantic and the concept of ghosts fascinated her. She was inspired to write her own stories that would be sentimental, romantic and deadly...or at least include graveyards! Kimberly has been writing since she was a young girl growing up in Manalapan, New Jersey. As a college student at The College of New Jersey, she was the Editor of the school paper. Although she dedicated a forty hour week to this non paying status, she considers it to be one of her best experiences for writing. After college she worked as an English teacher as a Second Language teacher while she completed two Masters. One in Education and the second at Rutgers University in Library Science. She left teaching to become a Young Adult Librarian in Rockaway, New Jersey. She felt that the library was overlooking this age group and she worked hard to create an incredible program that was dedicated to attracting young people to the library. She was very successful in this endeavor. Love did enter her life. She married Bob for more than one reason - however when I asked about him the first thing that she told me is that he is an amazing chef, preparing chopped liver and Latkes for her. He also seems to be very cooperative about vacationing to places with graveyards. During one of her pregnancies she finally sat down to write, what would become her first published book in 2011. Grunge Gods and Graveyards is set in 1996, a time frame that Kimberly feels close to. The book includes locations right here in Pike County! Very exciting, read it and see if you recognize any of these places. This book is the first in her The Grunge God Series, it was followed by the novella The Lady in Blue. Dead and Breakfast, part of her The Cayo Hueso Mystery Series, was inspired by her love of a graveyard she visited in Key West, Florida. This book is filled with mystery , history, ghost whisperers and, of course, a graveyard! Short stories are a great way to enjoy an evening... especially when the lights go out...Kimberly has a few for you, One Night is all You Need and Brave New Girls - Tales of Girls and Gadgets. Kimberly is currently working on a passion project - a slight diversion from graveyards and ghosts. There are many trials and tribulations to getting a book published and Kimberly should be writing her next book advising new authors on how to handle this. Her advice to future writers, take creative writing courses. My advice to you, get to one of our local Libraries, Amazon or Kindle and start reading her books!

Theres nothing to do at this point but enjoy it, right? Of course not. Gardens may move more slowly in August and immediate gardening tasks, like watering and weeding, may be all you think you really need to do. Its a stand and watch month, time to keep your senses alert for weeds that need to be pulled, pests that need to be stopped, and plants that need care. Tip: A natural repellent to slugs, snails, ants and other creepy-crawly bugs is coffee grounds! They cant stand the acidity of coffee. Sprinkling the soil a few inches from the base of plants will keep these pests away. Tip: Recipe for a natural weed killer: 1 gallon of white vinegar, 1 cup table salt, 1 tablespoon liquid dish detergent funnel into a plastic spray bottle. Drench the weeds on a dry sunny day. Weeds soaked with this solution die within several days. They wont be back and nothing else will ever grow there. Flower beds? By this point in the summer, some annuals may have become spindly or leggy. It is a good time to pinch or trim them back by as much as half their current height. They will soon begin to leaf out, look thicker and start to bloom again. Dead head flowers to keep the blooms coming. Continue to remove faded blooms on annuals such as geraniums, marigolds, petunias, salvia, verbena and zinnias. Even the most reliable summer bloomers stage a stronger show when you faithfully remove faded flowers. As the fall season approaches, some of the annuals begin to feel the effects of their age and the weather. When mums at local nurseries are available, pull out the annuals and move mums to fill in the vacancies. Geraniums? You dont have to wait until fall for root cuttings to bring indoors. Irises and poppies? Dig up and divide roots now. This is also a good time to prune shrubs and hedges as well as pine and fir trees. Water newly planted trees, shrubs, and perennials  any plants you added to your yard last fall or spring. These plants need weekly irrigation to ensure roots establish deeply. Take cuttings of plants you want to overwinter. Choices may include fuchsia, scented geranium, coleus, or wax begonia. Stick 3- to 4-inch green stem cuttings in soil. Place pots in a shaded spot, and keep soil moist. Ladybug is preparing for autumn and hopes you are too.",

CLC ASSOCIATION Board Approves Compactor Relocation Project BY : J EANNE C ALABRESE Relocation of the compactor area has been a topic of discussion in the Community for a while. When the compactor was originally set up, being close to maintenance and necessary three phase electric were big factors in its placement. It was also close to the member exit and the original mail area which made it convenient for members. With an increase of full time members comes a bigger demand for using the compactor. Parking for the area is limited and it can be challenging to maneuver due to limited sight and the amount of traffic entering and exiting the Member Only entrance and exit. Another concern with its current home is that on the other side of the fence, only feet away, is the pool area, particularly the baby pool where it could prove not so enjoyable on a hot summer day. The search for a new spot began last year. Factors such as convenience, ability to maintain and service the area, proximity to neighbors, aesthetics and electricity needed for its operation had to be considered. The area will also house the recycling bins which are currently located between the mail box lot and office. CLCA owns three lots adjacent to the mailbox area which is the proposed new site for the compactors. During their January meeting the Board of Directors approved preliminary plans and a 50,000.00 budget for the project. On the surface, moving the compactors appears to be a simple task. The reality is that there is a lot of work involved which includes permits, zoning hearings, installation of concrete pads, security fencing, gates, lighting, access lanes, parking area, security cameras, landscaping and electrical work. Additional requirements may also be identified through Township inspectors. While exploring permits needed for the project we were informed that the first step is to combine the three lots to the existing lot where the mailbox area, office, bus lot and security building are located. Requests for the lot combination have to be reviewed and approved by Pike County and Dingman Township. A surveyor has been hired for the purpose of drawing up the needed plans for the lots being combined. Once the lot combination is approved then applications must be submitted to Dingman Township for a zoning permit and any hearings needed for this project to proceed. Updates will be provided to the membership as they are received. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2016 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are imminent. Although we made it through three quarters of January with no significant snow for the entire season, temperatures did drop and roads have frozen. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVWgross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. Welcome to Conashaugh Lakes! Hello and welcome to Roger Homer and Luray Engel who relocated from Matamoras Pa. We hope enjoy your new home and our Community. Heads Up! Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read BY J EANNE C ALABRESE While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.com conashaughlakes. Please feel free to call the office if you do not have access to the internet. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non- emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they didnt know. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation. The results for 2015 House Decorating Contest were as follows: 3rd Place: The OToole Family 105 Hay Road 2nd Place: The Henry Family 195 Oneida Way 1st Place: The Conklin Family 118 Braxton Way Congratulations to the three winners!! I look forward to seeing all of the houses again next year. P.S. remember to nominate yourself or your neighbor to be included. There were so many houses that werent nominated that looked amazing. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2016 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION Office Notes J EANNE C ALABRESE Its hard to believe that we made it through two thirds of January before having a measurable snowfall. As this is being written, the East Coast of the country is battening down the hatches for what is predicted to be a storm of historic proportion. Nebulous reports all over the internet and on television have a lot of people wondering. Of course our area is predicted to have somewhere between zero to nine inches, so, well see. After the past two winters it would be fair to say we could use a break. Some notes of interest in our Community since the last issue of The Conashaugh Courier S EP t EM b ER : t ax Sales There was an upset tax sale on Wednesday September 23 at 10:00 a.m. with a total of 23 Conashaugh Properties on the sale list. Liens, mortgages, unpaid dues are not removed from properties sold at upset sales which may have resulted in none of the properties being sold that day. USDO t Random Drug t esting We renewed our contract with Foley Services. Foley is the third party administrator for our random drug testing for maintenance employees. Random drug testing is a requirement of USDOT and mandatory. Our current 3 permanent and one part time maintenance employee who hold CDL s participate in the program. Electric Meter at b ack Gate CRL Electric removed and reset the meter located at the back gate. They also grounded the junction for the fountain in Seneca Lake. This work was done in a further attempt to control damage from lightning in the back gate area. There havent been any thunderstorms since the work was completed to test results. Compactor Relocation Explored Research b egins It was necessary to research the type of electric needed for our existing compactor area. Our trash vendor, Waste Management was contacted but since they were not the installers of the equipment, they had no records. CRL Electric was on site for an unrelated project and the repair person inspected the compactors and confirmed they are 3 phase. An informal conversation with a Dingman Township inspector revealed that CLCA will need zoning permits for relocating the compactors from the current location. b occe at CLCA Official The Bocce court was completed by the day of the CLCA picnic. Maintenance did a beautiful job with this project see article. Many enjoyed the court that day and continued to do so afterwards. Positive feedback for this amenity was received. Community member Len Maruca has taken on heading a Bocce ball league for our Community. see article. Bocce Balls are available to borrow from the office. b udget Passed- New b oard Members Elected Budget passed 85 Yes 36 No Board Candidates elected: Michael Bulger, Bill King, Joe Kistle Following the Annual Meeting the Directors held elections. The 20152016 Board of Director Committee Liaison lineup is President, John Crerand, Security Vice Pres., Joe Kistle, Maintenance Secretary, Reggie Iglesias, Communications Treasurer, Fred Kline, Finance Director, Michael Bulger, Recreation Director, Bill King, Environmental Director, Josef Lalor ,Design Review Director, Bob Weed, Rules and Regulations O C t O b ER Can You Hear Me Now? Community Members attending the monthly Board Meeting suggested that the Community explore feasibility of a cell tower in the Community. The benefits expressed would be better cell reception and income for the Community. A third party vendor for Verizon visited the Community for the purpose of exploring areas within a radius for such service. There hasnt been an answer from Verizon as to whether or not they are interested. Nevertheless, construction of such a structure comes with zoning hearings and Community input. These projects can take well over one year from start to finish. Plow for 2012 Chevy A plow was purchased for the previously purchased 2012 Chevy Pick Up. The total cost was 7461.53 tax included. Security Following a suggestion made during the Annual Meeting, Security personnel began parking their personal vehicles during the day and the Security vehicle at night in the maintenance yard. Lighting was installed in the area by Maintenance. b oard Member Strategic Planning Liaison Appointed Following the elections in September there was still a vacancy on the Board of Directors. The Board appointed Brian Hamilton to that position. Prior to his appointment to the Board, Brian participated on the Security Committee. He also assisted the Rec Committee where his wife, Barbara is a member. t ree Removed There was a very large, dead tree located on CLCA owned property at the intersection of Iroquois and Flatbrook. The tree began shedding large sheets of bark and dead branches. Since it was located very close to power lines, an outside contractor was hired for removal. Wood was left for members to take. Compactor Relocation Project : Dave from maintenance located and identified the corners of the properties owned by CLCA behind officemailbox area and began working on a design for the area with an emphasis on smooth traffic flow while maintaining good aesthetics leaving tree buffers so not to create an unattractive area for neighbors or membersguests entering the community. N O v EM b ER Fire Damaged Home-Seneca Demolition of the fire damaged building completed by independent contractor. Property returned to undeveloped status. Dues Collection of current year 20152016. Seventeen files totaling 27,151.06 not including current year dues were referred to Sunrise Credit on November 6th. Review of files for referral to Magistrate commenced. Audit As occurs each year, Accounting firm Beck, Gogolski and Poska began their audit of CLCAs financial records and preparation of prior years taxes. The audit typically continues through the end of December, beginning of January with results reported in early February. This is a major annual project where all income and expenditures are reviewed by the auditors. Dams 800.00 Conashaugh Lake Dam Fee bill for 20152016 was received. DEP sent out billing early to allow communities to include in their budget planning. The payment for this fee is July 1, 2016. The bill is on diary for payment in June 2016. DEP also requesting that road dam on Flatbrook by the enhanced wetland area a.k.a. Beaver Pond be registered as a dam. Engineer Services Pennonni Associates began research into the DEP claim that this is a dam. Signage Pick up after your dog signage was installed at the front lake in response to concerns by members. Same signs were previously installed at the ball field and courts. Please pick up after your dog flyers were distributed on facebook and loop with a copy posted on the bulletin board. A stop sign was installed on Cree at the intersection of Seneca on November 10th in response to concerns expressed by Security Committee members. Private Property signs for front Seneca Lake were installed in response to request from the Rules and Regulations Committee. Signs read that the lake is for use by residents only and no trespassing.

Pocono 570.839.4174 Milford 570.296.6946 www.BHGwilkins.com t rash A review of trash totals after the close of the 20142015 fiscal revealed an unusual spike in the cost of trash. The tonnage though increased was not as significant as the cost. Bills for the past year were pulled and reviewed and it was discovered that we were overcharged for trash. Apparently sometime after our contract renewed, Waste Management began sending our bills electronically without consulting with the office. Since it is not our practice to do bankingbilling electronically WM was contacted and paper bills were requested. The timing of increased charges appears to coincide with this change. All bills were reviewed independently by WM and our book keeper. It was calculated that 7488.97 in overcharges were made. Reimbursement of the charges will be received via credits. Our contact at Waste Management has assured us that the proper adjustments have been made to our account to ensure proper credit and billing. 2016 Pike County Moth Suppression Program Findings by the Pike County Conservation District reveals that CLCA did not have the required number of healthy egg masses. The state requires there to be a minimum of 250 healthy egg masses per acre to be eligible for the spray program. This is good news as there are zero funds coming from the state to subsidize spraying D ECEM b ER Security United American Security notified us via invoice that the radar gun was calibrated by Guth Laboratories. A dash cam was installed in Securitys vehicle. A previous camera malfunctioned and was returned to the manufacturer who was unable to repair it but replaced it with a new camera. Security continues to be alerted to not allow drivers to park in the entrance of the community for the purpose of dropping off or picking up students. Signs were ordered from Build A Sign. Please note that due to the area being where snow is plowed during the winter, sign placement will need to be reviewed. Gates An increase of tailgating was reported to the office. Our gate security company was contacted to see if there is any additional equipment ie electric eyes that can be installed to have gates close. There is not. There are two ways in which the gate closure is operated, either by the timer or by ground loops. Closing times for gates decreased. Signage warning of no tailgating and fines ordered for installation at both entrances. Tailgating, regardless of whether or not you reside own here is not permitted. If you are found doing this you will be fined 150.00. If you break a gate doing this an additional 40.00 fine will be issued. Deliberately breaking the gate for entry to the Community is 200.00. Roads Crack Sealing Wayco was in the community sealing cracks on Oneida from pool to Iroquois on Tues Nov 24 and Weds. Nov 25 With the weather cooperating, Maintenance crews were out cleaning ditches and cutting back brush. Gate Card Project Please see article on this topic. It is very important for members to respond to any requests by the office to update vehicle information. All issued cards must be accounted for and failure to do so by time specified in the correspondence will result in your cards expiring. Individual contacts are made with members. Updates will be posted via the LOOP and our Facebook page. Gate cards are not to be shared with contractors or unregistered Associates. All members need to be aware there are electronic records of gate cards as well as calls from the guest gate. t rash The dumping of trash at the compactor or recyclables, whether those areas are open or closed is prohibited. Violations carry heavy fines. The areas are under surveillance. If you arrive to the compactor area and find it is full, call Security 1-800-682-4722 and request for the guard to report to the compactor. If during office business hours, call the office 686-4000. On that same note, if you have jammed your trash into the bin, and it is obvious that there is no more room in the compactor, please call these numbers so that the compactor can be run. Sunday is a busy day at the compactor it is observed that a lot of people bring a lot of trash, some bring as many as one dozen bags in one trip. This seems to occur more often in the winter when storing of trash is more tolerable due to cold temperatures. If you are doing this please be aware that it is taking up a lot of space and leaving others to deal with a lack of compactor space. Please try to make regular trips with your trash. The compactors are open weekdays from 7:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., and Sundays from 12:30 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. That is almost 100 hours of available dumping time! Flatbrook Way - Dam We were informed by our engineer, Pennonni Associates that based on criteria set by the DEP that the roadway Flatbrook falls under the category of being a dam. We were also informed that we may qualify for a waiver to register the dam. Criteria for a waiver included if the road Flatbrook existed before 1979. Mapssurveys were located dated 1969 and 1978 that clearly show the roads existence. Copies of these maps have been sent to Pennoni for the application for a waiver. b oat on Overbrook The boat located on lot 403A aka 115 Overbrook Run was observed as off its dry dock on the morning of Tues Dec 29. There were high winds, ice and sleet overnight. The boat appeared to have blown overfrom the wood stumps where it was mounted. According to documents posted on the property, it is up for Sheriff Sale on May 18, 2016. There have been a number of Sheriff and one Tax sale announced for this property with no change to its ownership status. The Mortgage Company, Wells Fargo was contacted and we have been informed that they cannot do anything with the boat until the property forecloses. Additional written correspondence putting Wells Fargo on notice of risks and possible liabilities have now been sent to Wells Fargo Mortgage in Maryland and Wells Fargo Corporate Offices in San Francisco. Wishing everyone a Happy Healthy and Safe New Year. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2016 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION Fall Dumpster Day Two dumpsters were used to collect close to ten tons of trash during the Fall Dumpster Day collection. Thank you to our Maintenance Crew and Community volunteers who made this day another success. The 2016 Spring Dumpster Day will be announced shortly. Gate Card Updates All members are required to update vehicle information on a regular basis. There have been requests in the past included with Annual Meeting Ballots and in the Courier to update information. Updated registrations are required when replacing or adding vehicles to the home fleet. Members are also requested to return cards for vehicles no longer owned. Updated registrations are also required for members who moved here from another state and have since changed from their former state to Pennsylvania. The Security Committee recommended that once again an update be performed. In early January the office began contacting individuals to provide update vehicle info for gate cards assigned to their property. Updating the office data base is a time consuming task. In an effort to start updating that information without a full-out stampede, there will be a number of phases taking place. The first phase which is ongoing involved pulling vehicle information for residents whose vehicles were registered at the office more than 90 days ago with out of state registrations. This applied to homeowners who reside in the Community full time. If you are in this category and havent been contacted yet, you will be contacted by the office and requested to provide updated registrations for any vehicles that are registered to your property for gate cards. Please note that there is a time limit for providing the requested infodocuments and that if there is no response within that time limit, your gate cards will expire. Updates for out of state registrations are nearing completion, the next phase will be announced via the LOOP and Facebook. Thank you CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2016 PAGE 7 CLC ASSOCIATION Thank You For Donations!

The purpose of the interview, is simply to solve the mystery of who he was and why he was barefoot. His immediate response was, I am me of course! I told him that he is our local celebrity, our neighborhood mystery man. The most talked about stranger in our community. He said, Yes, please come to my home and we will talk. For those of you that have moved here after 2010, Jean was not barefoot. With shoes on, he was remarkably different in style and verse. His French accent and his long hair have set him apart from your average Conashaugh man, long before the introduction of bare feet. When I arrived he welcomed me into his home. For a barefooted man, his home is normal in every way. Beautiful to the eye and warm and welcoming. Out of respect to his bare feet, I was going to offer to take off my shoes. However he quickly escorted me into his dining room and graciously gave me a comfortable seat. I quickly slid my feet under the table not sure if my shoes made him uncomfortable or not. I asked him if he knew of all the theories that are being told in our community about him. He shrugged and said perhaps. I offered to tell him what I had heard. At this point his lovely wife Maureen, appeared, not barefoot, just shoeless, wearing white athletic socks. She was eager to hear the theories, claiming that she thought she had heard them all. I will mention a few here, there are more, as there should be. Every celebrity has less fact then fiction that surrounds them. Almost all of these theories have been discussed by strangers to me, at the mailboxes. Jean has made a huge impact in our community just by opening his car door and walking to his box, barefooted. I have been making this same journey for almost eight years and I am sure no one remembers me as the lady with the shoes on. First theory: he belongs to a religion that doesnt believe in wearing shoes. Solving The Mystery of The Barefoot Man of Conashaugh Lakes - Our Own Jean Forichon Second theory: he really isnt French - but a Russian Spy and the hair, mustache and bare feet are a disguise. Included in this Russian Spy theory is the belief that he is a chemical engineer working on some top secret chemical. Along the same lines, the theory that he is in the Witness Protection. Third theory: he is a Hollywood writerdirector producer who lives here for the quiet so he can work in peace - barefoot? If you have assumed any of the above theories, or any theory I havent mentioned, let me be the first to tell you that you are wrong! Jean Forichon is none of the above - he is so much more. He was born, barefoot and without mustache, in France. Shortly after birth he learned French not Russian, to this day, he still speaks French fluently. Mr. Forichon attended a private, all boys, Catholic not some unknown barefoot religion boarding school in France, shoes were part of the curriculum. Jean considers himself to be a devout Catholic. When a fellow parishioner suggested to his priest, Father Paul, that maybe they should buy him some shoes, he took it with good humor and remains grateful that someone thought enough of him to want to take care of him. As far as Hollywood, well, the truth is that when he first came to America in 1985, he thought he wanted to live in California. That soon changed when he fell in love with New York City where he attended Columbia University and graduated. A famous Hollywood movie star, Jake Gyllenhaal, also attended Columbia University. Which may be the closest that Jean has ever come to a career in Hollywood. One very bad thing about bare footing here in Conashaugh Lakes is running on the roads. Especially when the little gravel rocks that are there after a snow and ice storm. Jean told me that they really arent comfortable on his feet. He asked me if I knew what kind of damage those little rocks do to our snow tires...seriously ,could his feet be stronger than our snow tires? How does the world outside of Conashaugh Lakes approach those famous bare feet? Fortunately, Jeans career in BI Business Intelligence gives him the advantage point of working from his home in his bare feet. He does take those bare feet with him wherever he goes and finds little or no objections to them. The stares and gawks he gets from passersby doesnt seem to affect him either. Although he did tell me, his three wonderful children Kathleen, Britney and Ashton are a little embarrassed. They ask him if he could just sit in the car and wait for them, no need to get out! Maureen told me that she originally thought he was going thru a midlife crisis. Then, with a twinkle of love in her eye and pride in her voice he does it because he traditionally likes to go against the grain. Jean misses his homeland. The food, wine, and family he left behind so many years ago are calling him back. He was there recently for a family visit and he told me that running ten miles a day there was easy on his bare feet. Although his father was very surprised to see his bare feet in attendance everywhere they went, he didnt object and admired his sons unique barefoot stand. Jean will tell you, if you ever ask, that he does it because he is not afraid to be different. Jean says, People are always worried about what others will say.

How she would test the porridge, the chairs and the beds until she found the one perfect for herself. A number of members in the Community began reporting damage to their septic mounds and the pipes on them. Vandalism? Unruly teens? Unfriendly neighbors? The phenomenon was a little weird. Who does this? Well it is possible that the culprit in the mysterious damage could have been a bear. This information all came quite by accident during with a conversation with another member who mentioned a bear was tearing up their septic mound. Following that conversation the only thing to do was check GOOGLE. There werent a lot of facts on this topic but in one discussion it was mentioned that bears eat the most disgusting decayed animals they come across so why would a septic system deter them? There was also some thought that bears smell fats and other grease that some people pour but shouldnt down their kitchen drains. Also learned was that garbage disposals are not a popular kitchen appliance in these parts maybe because the debris passed through them can take up as much as 50 of a holding tank. While the bear theory may be a lot of speculation, it seems to make sense which leads back to the Goldilocks story. Be cognizant of what you are putting into your septic system and how it can result in costly repairs either due to break down or becoming a bruin breakfast.

This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicles at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible to for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe.

March can come in like a lamb and go out like a lion or the reverse. In any event its the perfect time to survey the effects of winter on your landscape. Late winter is a particularly good time to prune ornamental trees because you can really see the structure of the tree. Pruning for dead wood is appropriate to address any time, but its especially easy to identify whats dead this time of year. Remember those perennials you purchased at the end of the season? They are especially vulnerable to heaving so if a bit of mild weather comes along, its a good idea to push those heaved plants back into the soil and tamp the dirt lightly with your foot. Any ornamental grasses left up for winter interest should be cut back before they come out of dormancy. Trim with shears, a string trimmer or a mower on the highest setting. Evergreens such as azaleas, hollies and most other fast-growing broadleaf evergreens renew most vigorously in spring, so prune them now. Cut back to bare wood, if necessary. You primarily should be cutting back things that have been winter-killed. Do drastic pruning of old shrubs that have become a nuisance such as rhododendrons that are blocking a driveway, walk or window. Azaleas can be cut to about 6-18 inches high. You will lose this years flowers. But they will grow back into full, small shrubs in one season. Trim back spent perennials that were not done last fall this includes verbena, mums and black-eyed Susans. In spring lavender, sage and butterfly bush are easier to see what parts of the plants have died over the winter and which branches need trimming. Some insects and disease-causing organisms can winter over and emerge again in spring. Now is the time to spray a dormant-oil insecticide or fungicide. Besides reducing the necessity for more spraying during the growing season, spraying now will ensure the least negative impact on the environment. If you dont want to use a petroleum-based product, you can make your own by mixing 1 cup vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons liquid soap and slowly adding 1 gallon of water. Use a clean sprayer. If you didnt clean your garden tools and equipment last fall, now is the time to check their condition, repair or replace them. Clean, sharpen and oil shears, pruners and other cutting tools; wash rakes, shovels and hand tools; sand and oil wooden handles. House plants will react to longer days and brighter light at this time of the year by putting out new growth. The end of March is a good time to pinch them back to generate new growth and to thicken them. You can begin fertilizing again with a diluted solution of soluble house plant food. Turn your plants a quarter turn each week to make sure all sides receive adequate light and to keep their shape balanced. Mist or spray your houseplants to clean away the winters dust, prevent Spider Mites and add a little humidity. Remain vigilante in watching for insects and pests. It is much easier to win a bug war if you are aware of the infestation in its early stages. If you do a few tasks over the next few weeks, you will get a head start on the season.

CLC ASSOCIATION Board Approves Compactor Relocation Project BY : J EANNE C ALABRESE Relocation of the compactor area has been a topic of discussion in the Community for a while. When the compactor was originally set up, being close to maintenance and necessary three phase electric were big factors in its placement. It was also close to the member exit and the original mail area which made it convenient for members. With an increase of full time members comes a bigger demand for using the compactor. Parking for the area is limited and it can be challenging to maneuver due to limited sight and the amount of traffic entering and exiting the Member Only entrance and exit. Another concern with its current home is that on the other side of the fence, only feet away, is the pool area, particularly the baby pool where it could prove not so enjoyable on a hot summer day. The search for a new spot began last year. Factors such as convenience, ability to maintain and service the area, proximity to neighbors, aesthetics and electricity needed for its operation had to be considered. The area will also house the recycling bins which are currently located between the mail box lot and office. CLCA owns three lots adjacent to the mailbox area which is the proposed new site for the compactors. During their January meeting the Board of Directors approved preliminary plans and a 50,000.00 budget for the project. On the surface, moving the compactors appears to be a simple task. The reality is that there is a lot of work involved which includes permits, zoning hearings, installation of concrete pads, security fencing, gates, lighting, access lanes, parking area, security cameras, landscaping and electrical work. Additional requirements may also be identified through Township inspectors. While exploring permits needed for the project we were informed that the first step is to combine the three lots to the existing lot where the mailbox area, office, bus lot and security building are located. Requests for the lot combination have to be reviewed and approved by Pike County and Dingman Township. A surveyor has been hired for the purpose of drawing up the needed plans for the lots being combined. Once the lot combination is approved then applications must be submitted to Dingman Township for a zoning permit and any hearings needed for this project to proceed. Updates will be provided to the membership as they are received.",

Although we made it through three quarters of January with no significant snow for the entire season, temperatures did drop and roads have frozen. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVWgross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. Welcome to Conashaugh Lakes! Hello and welcome to Roger Homer and Luray Engel who relocated from Matamoras Pa. We hope enjoy your new home and our Community. Heads Up! Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read BY J EANNE C ALABRESE While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.com conashaughlakes. Please feel free to call the office if you do not have access to the internet. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non- emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they didnt know. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation.

As this is being written, the East Coast of the country is battening down the hatches for what is predicted to be a storm of historic proportion. Nebulous reports all over the internet and on television have a lot of people wondering. Of course our area is predicted to have somewhere between zero to nine inches, so, well see. After the past two winters it would be fair to say we could use a break. Some notes of interest in our Community since the last issue of The Conashaugh Courier S EP t EM b ER : t ax Sales There was an upset tax sale on Wednesday September 23 at 10:00 a.m. with a total of 23 Conashaugh Properties on the sale list. Liens, mortgages, unpaid dues are not removed from properties sold at upset sales which may have resulted in none of the properties being sold that day. USDO t Random Drug t esting We renewed our contract with Foley Services. Foley is the third party administrator for our random drug testing for maintenance employees. Random drug testing is a requirement of USDOT and mandatory. Our current 3 permanent and one part time maintenance employee who hold CDL s participate in the program. Electric Meter at b ack Gate CRL Electric removed and reset the meter located at the back gate. They also grounded the junction for the fountain in Seneca Lake. This work was done in a further attempt to control damage from lightning in the back gate area. There havent been any thunderstorms since the work was completed to test results. Compactor Relocation Explored Research b egins It was necessary to research the type of electric needed for our existing compactor area. Our trash vendor, Waste Management was contacted but since they were not the installers of the equipment, they had no records. CRL Electric was on site for an unrelated project and the repair person inspected the compactors and confirmed they are 3 phase. An informal conversation with a Dingman Township inspector revealed that CLCA will need zoning permits for relocating the compactors from the current location. b occe at CLCA Official The Bocce court was completed by the day of the CLCA picnic. Maintenance did a beautiful job with this project see article. Many enjoyed the court that day and continued to do so afterwards. Positive feedback for this amenity was received.

Community Members attending the monthly Board Meeting suggested that the Community explore feasibility of a cell tower in the Community. The benefits expressed would be better cell reception and income for the Community. A third party vendor for Verizon visited the Community for the purpose of exploring areas within a radius for such service. There hasnt been an answer from Verizon as to whether or not they are interested. Nevertheless, construction of such a structure comes with zoning hearings and Community input. These projects can take well over one year from start to finish. Plow for 2012 Chevy A plow was purchased for the previously purchased 2012 Chevy Pick Up. The total cost was 7461.53 tax included.

Lighting was installed in the area by Maintenance. b oard Member Strategic Planning Liaison Appointed Following the elections in September there was still a vacancy on the Board of Directors. The Board appointed Brian Hamilton to that position. Prior to his appointment to the Board, Brian participated on the Security Committee. He also assisted the Rec Committee where his wife, Barbara is a member. t ree Removed There was a very large, dead tree located on CLCA owned property at the intersection of Iroquois and Flatbrook. The tree began shedding large sheets of bark and dead branches. Since it was located very close to power lines, an outside contractor was hired for removal. Wood was left for members to take. Compactor Relocation Project : Dave from maintenance located and identified the corners of the properties owned by CLCA behind officemailbox area and began working on a design for the area with an emphasis on smooth traffic flow while maintaining good aesthetics leaving tree buffers so not to create an unattractive area for neighbors or membersguests entering the community.

The tonnage though increased was not as significant as the cost. Bills for the past year were pulled and reviewed and it was discovered that we were overcharged for trash. Apparently sometime after our contract renewed, Waste Management began sending our bills electronically without consulting with the office. Since it is not our practice to do bankingbilling electronically WM was contacted and paper bills were requested. The timing of increased charges appears to coincide with this change. All bills were reviewed independently by WM and our book keeper. It was calculated that 7488.97 in overcharges were made. Reimbursement of the charges will be received via credits. Our contact at Waste Management has assured us that the proper adjustments have been made to our account to ensure proper credit and billing. 2016 Pike County Moth Suppression Program Findings by the Pike County Conservation District reveals that CLCA did not have the required number of healthy egg masses.

This is good news as there are zero funds coming from the state to subsidize spraying D ECEM b ER Security United American Security notified us via invoice that the radar gun was calibrated by Guth Laboratories. A dash cam was installed in Securitys vehicle. A previous camera malfunctioned and was returned to the manufacturer who was unable to repair it but replaced it with a new camera. Security continues to be alerted to not allow drivers to park in the entrance of the community for the purpose of dropping off or picking up students. Signs were ordered from Build A Sign. Please note that due to the area being where snow is plowed during the winter, sign placement will need to be reviewed. Gates An increase of tailgating was reported to the office. Our gate security company was contacted to see if there is any additional equipment ie electric eyes that can be installed to have gates close. There is not. There are two ways in which the gate closure is operated, either by the timer or by ground loops. Closing times for gates decreased. Signage warning of no tailgating and fines ordered for installation at both entrances. Tailgating, regardless of whether or not you reside own here is not permitted. If you are found doing this you will be fined 150.00. If you break a gate doing this an additional 40.00 fine will be issued. Deliberately breaking the gate for entry to the Community is 200.00. Roads Crack Sealing Wayco was in the community sealing cracks on Oneida from pool to Iroquois on Tues Nov 24 and Weds. Nov 25 With the weather cooperating, Maintenance crews were out cleaning ditches and cutting back brush. Gate Card Project Please see article on this topic. It is very important for members to respond to any requests by the office to update vehicle information. All issued cards must be accounted for and failure to do so by time specified in the correspondence will result in your cards expiring. Individual contacts are made with members. Updates will be posted via the LOOP and our Facebook page. Gate cards are not to be shared with contractors or unregistered Associates. All members need to be aware there are electronic records of gate cards as well as calls from the guest gate. t rash The dumping of trash at the compactor or recyclables, whether those areas are open or closed is prohibited. Violations carry heavy fines. The areas are under surveillance. If you arrive to the compactor area and find it is full, call Security 1-800-682-4722 and request for the guard to report to the compactor. If during office business hours, call the office 686-4000. On that same note, if you have jammed your trash into the bin, and it is obvious that there is no more room in the compactor, please call these numbers so that the compactor can be run. Sunday is a busy day at the compactor it is observed that a lot of people bring a lot of trash, some bring as many as one dozen bags in one trip. This seems to occur more often in the winter when storing of trash is more tolerable due to cold temperatures. If you are doing this please be aware that it is taking up a lot of space and leaving others to deal with a lack of compactor space. Please try to make regular trips with your trash. The compactors are open weekdays from 7:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., and Sundays from 12:30 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. That is almost 100 hours of available dumping time! Flatbrook Way - Dam We were informed by our engineer, Pennonni Associates that based on criteria set by the DEP that the roadway Flatbrook falls under the category of being a dam. We were also informed that we may qualify for a waiver to register the dam. Criteria for a waiver included if the road Flatbrook existed before 1979. Mapssurveys were located dated 1969 and 1978 that clearly show the roads existence. Copies of these maps have been sent to Pennoni for the application for a waiver. b oat on Overbrook The boat located on lot 403A aka 115 Overbrook Run was observed as off its dry dock on the morning of Tues Dec 29. There were high winds, ice and sleet overnight. The boat appeared to have blown overfrom the wood stumps where it was mounted. According to documents posted on the property, it is up for Sheriff Sale on May 18, 2016. There have been a number of Sheriff and one Tax sale announced for this property with no change to its ownership status. The Mortgage Company, Wells Fargo was contacted and we have been informed that they cannot do anything with the boat until the property forecloses. Additional written correspondence putting Wells Fargo on notice of risks and possible liabilities have now been sent to Wells Fargo Mortgage in Maryland and Wells Fargo Corporate Offices in San Francisco. Wishing everyone a Happy Healthy and Safe New Year.",

Thank you to our Maintenance Crew and Community volunteers who made this day another success. The 2016 Spring Dumpster Day will be announced shortly. Gate Card Updates All members are required to update vehicle information on a regular basis. There have been requests in the past included with Annual Meeting Ballots and in the Courier to update information. Updated registrations are required when replacing or adding vehicles to the home fleet. Members are also requested to return cards for vehicles no longer owned. Updated registrations are also required for members who moved here from another state and have since changed from their former state to Pennsylvania. The Security Committee recommended that once again an update be performed. In early January the office began contacting individuals to provide update vehicle info for gate cards assigned to their property. Updating the office data base is a time consuming task. In an effort to start updating that information without a full-out stampede, there will be a number of phases taking place. The first phase which is ongoing involved pulling vehicle information for residents whose vehicles were registered at the office more than 90 days ago with out of state registrations. This applied to homeowners who reside in the Community full time. If you are in this category and havent been contacted yet, you will be contacted by the office and requested to provide updated registrations for any vehicles that are registered to your property for gate cards. Please note that there is a time limit for providing the requested infodocuments and that if there is no response within that time limit, your gate cards will expire. Updates for out of state registrations are nearing completion, the next phase will be announced via the LOOP and Facebook. Thank you",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2016 PAGE 8 CONASHAUGH NEWS B Y V ALERIE F ERLAUTO I think he knew the day would come when a stranger would approach him to ask for an interview. The purpose of the interview, is simply to solve the mystery of who he was and why he was barefoot. His immediate response was, I am me of course! I told him that he is our local celebrity, our neighborhood mystery man. The most talked about stranger in our community. He said, Yes, please come to my home and we will talk. For those of you that have moved here after 2010, Jean was not barefoot. With shoes on, he was remarkably different in style and verse. His French accent and his long hair have set him apart from your average Conashaugh man, long before the introduction of bare feet. When I arrived he welcomed me into his home. For a barefooted man, his home is normal in every way. Beautiful to the eye and warm and welcoming. Out of respect to his bare feet, I was going to offer to take off my shoes. However he quickly escorted me into his dining room and graciously gave me a comfortable seat. I quickly slid my feet under the table not sure if my shoes made him uncomfortable or not. I asked him if he knew of all the theories that are being told in our community about him. He shrugged and said perhaps. I offered to tell him what I had heard. At this point his lovely wife Maureen, appeared, not barefoot, just shoeless, wearing white athletic socks. She was eager to hear the theories, claiming that she thought she had heard them all. I will mention a few here, there are more, as there should be. Every celebrity has less fact then fiction that surrounds them. Almost all of these theories have been discussed by strangers to me, at the mailboxes. Jean has made a huge impact in our community just by opening his car door and walking to his box, barefooted. I have been making this same journey for almost eight years and I am sure no one remembers me as the lady with the shoes on. First theory: he belongs to a religion that doesnt believe in wearing shoes. Solving The Mystery of The Barefoot Man of Conashaugh Lakes - Our Own Jean Forichon Second theory: he really isnt French - but a Russian Spy and the hair, mustache and bare feet are a disguise. Included in this Russian Spy theory is the belief that he is a chemical engineer working on some top secret chemical. Along the same lines, the theory that he is in the Witness Protection. Third theory: he is a Hollywood writerdirector producer who lives here for the quiet so he can work in peace - barefoot? If you have assumed any of the above theories, or any theory I havent mentioned, let me be the first to tell you that you are wrong! Jean Forichon is none of the above - he is so much more. He was born, barefoot and without mustache, in France. Shortly after birth he learned French not Russian, to this day, he still speaks French fluently. Mr. Forichon attended a private, all boys, Catholic not some unknown barefoot religion boarding school in France, shoes were part of the curriculum. Jean considers himself to be a devout Catholic. When a fellow parishioner suggested to his priest, Father Paul, that maybe they should buy him some shoes, he took it with good humor and remains grateful that someone thought enough of him to want to take care of him. As far as Hollywood, well, the truth is that when he first came to America in 1985, he thought he wanted to live in California. That soon changed when he fell in love with New York City where he attended Columbia University and graduated. A famous Hollywood movie star, Jake Gyllenhaal, also attended Columbia University. Which may be the closest that Jean has ever come to a career in Hollywood. One very bad thing about bare footing here in Conashaugh Lakes is running on the roads. Especially when the little gravel rocks that are there after a snow and ice storm. Jean told me that they really arent comfortable on his feet. He asked me if I knew what kind of damage those little rocks do to our snow tires...seriously ,could his feet be stronger than our snow tires? How does the world outside of Conashaugh Lakes approach those famous bare feet? Fortunately, Jeans career in BI Business Intelligence gives him the advantage point of working from his home in his bare feet. He does take those bare feet with him wherever he goes and finds little or no objections to them. The stares and gawks he gets from passersby doesnt seem to affect him either. Although he did tell me, his three wonderful children Kathleen, Britney and Ashton are a little embarrassed. They ask him if he could just sit in the car and wait for them, no need to get out! Maureen told me that she originally thought he was going thru a midlife crisis. Then, with a twinkle of love in her eye and pride in her voice he does it because he traditionally likes to go against the grain. Jean misses his homeland. The food, wine, and family he left behind so many years ago are calling him back. He was there recently for a family visit and he told me that running ten miles a day there was easy on his bare feet. Although his father was very surprised to see his bare feet in attendance everywhere they went, he didnt object and admired his sons unique barefoot stand. Jean will tell you, if you ever ask, that he does it because he is not afraid to be different. Jean says, People are always worried about what others will say. He doesnt care what people say or think about him. Having spent a few hours in his home talking about bare feet, his life, his wife and children, I can tell you that he is truly a unique man. Talented, devoted Father, loving husband, musician, a true barefooted Cosmopolitan man!",

If you are an owner selling your property and have any questions on this subject, please contact the office. This One Is Just Right Everyone remembers the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. How she would test the porridge, the chairs and the beds until she found the one perfect for herself. A number of members in the Community began reporting damage to their septic mounds and the pipes on them. Vandalism? Unruly teens? Unfriendly neighbors? The phenomenon was a little weird. Who does this? Well it is possible that the culprit in the mysterious damage could have been a bear. This information all came quite by accident during with a conversation with another member who mentioned a bear was tearing up their septic mound. Following that conversation the only thing to do was check GOOGLE. There werent a lot of facts on this topic but in one discussion it was mentioned that bears eat the most disgusting decayed animals they come across so why would a septic system deter them? There was also some thought that bears smell fats and other grease that some people pour but shouldnt down their kitchen drains. Also learned was that garbage disposals are not a popular kitchen appliance in these parts maybe because the debris passed through them can take up as much as 50 of a holding tank. While the bear theory may be a lot of speculation, it seems to make sense which leads back to the Goldilocks story. Be cognizant of what you are putting into your septic system and how it can result in costly repairs either due to break down or becoming a bruin breakfast.

This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicles at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible to for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Thank you for doing your part to keep our roads safe.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2016 PAGE 19 Waking The Garden From Its Winter Sleep February is the bridge between winter and spring. March can come in like a lamb and go out like a lion or the reverse. In any event its the perfect time to survey the effects of winter on your landscape. Late winter is a particularly good time to prune ornamental trees because you can really see the structure of the tree. Pruning for dead wood is appropriate to address any time, but its especially easy to identify whats dead this time of year. Remember those perennials you purchased at the end of the season? They are especially vulnerable to heaving so if a bit of mild weather comes along, its a good idea to push those heaved plants back into the soil and tamp the dirt lightly with your foot. Any ornamental grasses left up for winter interest should be cut back before they come out of dormancy. Trim with shears, a string trimmer or a mower on the highest setting. Evergreens such as azaleas, hollies and most other fast-growing broadleaf evergreens renew most vigorously in spring, so prune them now. Cut back to bare wood, if necessary. You primarily should be cutting back things that have been winter-killed. Do drastic pruning of old shrubs that have become a nuisance such as rhododendrons that are blocking a driveway, walk or window. Azaleas can be cut to about 6-18 inches high. You will lose this years flowers. But they will grow back into full, small shrubs in one season. Trim back spent perennials that were not done last fall this includes verbena, mums and black-eyed Susans. In spring lavender, sage and butterfly bush are easier to see what parts of the plants have died over the winter and which branches need trimming. Some insects and disease-causing organisms can winter over and emerge again in spring. Now is the time to spray a dormant-oil insecticide or fungicide. Besides reducing the necessity for more spraying during the growing season, spraying now will ensure the least negative impact on the environment. If you dont want to use a petroleum-based product, you can make your own by mixing 1 cup vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons liquid soap and slowly adding 1 gallon of water. Use a clean sprayer. If you didnt clean your garden tools and equipment last fall, now is the time to check their condition, repair or replace them. Clean, sharpen and oil shears, pruners and other cutting tools; wash rakes, shovels and hand tools; sand and oil wooden handles. House plants will react to longer days and brighter light at this time of the year by putting out new growth. The end of March is a good time to pinch them back to generate new growth and to thicken them. You can begin fertilizing again with a diluted solution of soluble house plant food. Turn your plants a quarter turn each week to make sure all sides receive adequate light and to keep their shape balanced. Mist or spray your houseplants to clean away the winters dust, prevent Spider Mites and add a little humidity. Remain vigilante in watching for insects and pests. It is much easier to win a bug war if you are aware of the infestation in its early stages. If you do a few tasks over the next few weeks, you will get a head start on the season.

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20172018 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 30 th and coincidentally is the last day of the CLCA Fiscal Year. The meeting will be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Light refreshments will be served. All members will receive a ballot to vote in the mail. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned. For example if two people together own fi ve properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2017 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Yes, We Do and Yes, They Do While it is not a frequent occurrence, gates do get broken by individuals looking to enter the community. In case anyone is wondering, yes, we do contact the police and yes, they do respond and help us. If you are a follower of our Facebook Page you may occasionally see a post where it is announced that we are looking for someone who broke a gate. Included in these posts are the date, location, general vehicle description and time of the incident. Specifics such as the plate number and make and model of the vehicle are not announced as we do not want people taking these matters into their own hands. People have asked why this information is posted andor why we just dont call the police immediately. There are a number of reasons. As you may or may not be aware, there is limited police presence in these parts. Outside of a couple of private police departments, PSP Blooming Grove is responsible for covering Pike County in its entirety, including Interstate 84. That is a huge territory and the Troopers are stretched pretty thin. If we are able to pinpoint who breaks our gate without police involvement, we will handle the matter independently with the actor. It is our hope that an actor will learn of us knowing what they did through the Facebook post, and come forward. Five to seven days are usually given before the police are contacted. We have had some success with gate breakers coming forward without having to chase them or call the police. Sometimes, there are explanations as to why this happened. Some of those explanations are very creative while others are well, not so much. The PS Troopers have been very helpful in working with us in these matters and we are appreciative of their assistance. How do I get into the Community if I dont have my card? As a reminder all property owners are issued numbers unique to their property for use at the telepad. In the event that you are outside the gate without a gate card or someone home to let you inside you can use the number assigned to your property by dialing 0001 from the telepad. Keep the number in your wallet or car so that it is with you in the event that you need it. The number is for use by members only and not for sharing with contractors, friends or others. If you have any questions or do not know your propertys assigned number, call the office and we will be glad to help you. Hello and Welcome To... There have been a number of home sales in the Community over the last several months. A big welcome to our newest members including Ralph Guarino who arrived in March from East Islip, NY; Bob and Shannon Hazard along with their children Jaxson, Cecelia, Max and Elijah from New Jersey joined us in June and Davy and Debbie Washburn who along with their children Kayley, Jonathan, Alleigh, Samuel, Warren and Titus traveled over from Matamoras, Pa to live here. We wish you much happiness and joy in your new homes. If you are a new member and would like to be introduced in a future issue of the Courier, please complete the form in your resale packet and submit it to the office or give us a call. www.tashlik.com 1 570-828-2306 800-634-5964 1506 Route 739 stashlikptd.net Serving Milford Dingmans Ferry and Pike County Pennsylvani a Pending Sale Pending Sale Sold Sold Sold MAKE TASHLIK A HOUSE WORD CALL FOR A FREE MARKET ANALYSIS Sold WANTED REAL ESTATE SALESPERSON CALL STAN TASHLIK 570-828-2306 CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2017 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION Trash News As of July 1 2017 County Waste became our new trash and recycling hauler. County Waste has been a service company in this area for several years. In addition to working with us for dumpster day, they came highly recommended by a number of communities and townships that have been receivers of their services. Trash and Recycling Hourssubject to change Trash: Monday through Friday - 7:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday - 10:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. Recycling: The number of bins has increased to four. Bins are emptied on Mondays and Thursdays. That schedule is subject to change due to holidays. Our new recycling bins have deposit slots on the back which allows deposit 247. The large lids on top of the bins are unlocked until dusk to allow for convenient deposit of your recyclables. Unfortunately, some folks have used the recycling bins for disposal of trash and on one occasion a hot tub. If activity such as this continues, we will have no alternative other than to keep the top lids of the bins locked at all times. Recycling is single stream. You do not have to separate items. Please, please, please, DO NOT place Styrofoam or plastic bags in the recycle bins. Styrofoam needs to be thrown in the compactor. There is a trash bin at recycling for your plastic bags. Please fl atten your boxes. Placing intact boxes takes up unnecessary space and causes the bins to become full quickly. Recycling saves the community money. Recycling is done at a flat rate. We are charged by the ton for compactor trash. Compactor Dos and Donts: The compactor is for household trash. Household trash is not everything from your house. It includes refuse which comes from the bathroom and kitchen of a house like organic waste, food scraps, non-recyclable food and product containers, etc. Many of us came from areas where trash was picked up curbside. You would not put a bicycle, tires, wall to wall carpet or two by fours from a demolition at the curb with your trash cans. It is likely a special pick up would be in order. Our compactors are the same. Larger items need to be held for Dumpster Day or take them to the dump. Compactors are not for cleaning out your house when you are moving. Rent a dumpster. Do close the compactor doors after depositing your trash to prevent entry by animals. Do not leave trash or recyclables on the ground. With fi nes up to 500.00, it can cost you big time. There are phone numbers to call. During business hours call the office 686-4000. Outside of business hours call Security dispatch 1-800-916-7501 and request that the officer on duty report to the compactor area. Attention members who bring five or more bags of trash at a time andor fill the bin in one visit, dont jam your trash in the bin and slam the door to keep it there only to fall on the next person who opens the door. Not very pleasant. If you are going to hoard your trash and cram the compactor please have the courtesy to call for the trash to be compacted. The weekends are busy at the compactor. On Saturdays and Sundays there is a part time attendant on duty. Pete keeps the trash compacted late mornings and early afternoons. He also helps to keep unwanted items from being thrown into the compactors. He has a job. Please do not harass him or give him a hard time because you do not want to follow instructions, cant read signs or dont give a hoot. Last but not least. Do not allow friends, outsiders, non-members passage into Conashaugh for the purpose of depositing their trash. If this is discovered 1. You will be fined for illegal dumping up to 300.00; 2. If they use a card assigned to you add an additional 500.00 fi ne; 3. Your guest will be reported to the police for theft of services. Plain and simple. Dont do it. Thank you to our members who respect our trash rules and take the time to notify us of conditions and situations that need attention andor action. Not as simple as thought: A number of you if not most are wondering, hey when is the compactor moving? The plan has not been scrapped but after much thought and review it is a little more than just picking up the cans and putting them elsewhere. It is a project that needs to be done correctly and appears to need more review, possibly from an engineer. The project continues to be worked on and progressplans will be reported as they occur. Thank you for your patience. The next CLCA Dumpster Day will be held Saturday, October 7th from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m. Watch for details. Please note that all loose debris must be bagged and nails removed from wood. Loads not meeting these requirements will be rejected. SCHOOL IS OPEN Please Drive Carefully Monday August 28th is the first day of school. Some friendly bus stop reminders:  Please allow ample time to travel to the bus stop  Follow all travel direction signs in the lot  Speed limit in the parking lot is 5mph  Park in one space  Do not park in aisles  Young riders should be accompanied by parents guardians to their buses  Do not release or pick up children at the main entranceexit areas The parking lot procedures for afternoon pick up for elementary school buses are still in effect. All vehicles must be parked and not moving when buses for the el- ementaryprimary school are present in the afternoon. There are number of new families in our community and others new to the bus stop experience. Please be courteous and helpful to others. The first days of school are hectic and many parents come to the lot to experience this exciting day. Please feel free to use space closest to the office in the mailbox area parking during the first week of school. Please do not block mailbox parking lot aisles. There are members who need to get their mail. If you have any questions, please contact the office 686-4000. Thank you! Are You Selling Your Property? Please be advised that Resale Documents are required for all property sales before the property closes. If you are an owner selling your property and have any questions on this subject, please contact the office. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2017 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION TH A NK YOU! TH A NK YOU! We interrupt this issue of the Conashaugh Courier to shout out the following thanks! Annette Musano, Dawn, Angelina and Isabel Amadore for picking up trash from our roads on Earth Day! Neil Johnson, Fred Kline, Eddie Calabrese, Joe Kistle, Larry Farnum, Bill King, David Weed and Scott Bailey for volunteering and working with our Maintenance staff to keep the garbage moving at the Spring Dumpster Day. Alain and Maryann Lajoux for pruning our plants at the front sign. Dave Westerfer for creating lovely planters at our entrances. For all of our volunteers who work to keep Conashaugh a nice place to live! CLCA ELECTIONS NEIL JOHNSON I have been a full time Conashaugh resident since 2001 and have held a number of Board positions including President on and off since 2002. I have participated in a number of volunteer positions including cooking for the CLCA Annual Picnic, Dumpster Day, CLCA Fishing Day and Halloween Patrols. Committees that I have been involved with include Security, Maintenance, Recreation, Environmental and Design Review. Conashaugh has grown over the years and is one of the most desirable Communities in this area. My wish is to continue contributing to keep our Community on this positive track. Thank you for your vote this election. Neil Johnson JOHN MCCAULEY I have been a full time resident for almost thirty years and a property owner a few years longer. I have taken my time on the Board several times over the years. As a matter of fact I served as President two years, Vice President two years, all while working a full time job. I also have served on several diff erent Committees over the years. I am currently retired from my full time job however, I am still an active volunteer as a District Commissioner for the Boy Scouts and a proud member of the Knights of Columbus. These activities are to benefi t our overall community and I hope to be an asset to CLCA. I believe that many of the rules and regulations need to be either updated or eliminated to reflect the current times. While the history of Conashaugh is rich in volunteer eff orts, and we as a Community need to be both proud and thankful for that, we also need to keep the tradition going. The bottom line is what we do as a Community we do for ourselves. I hope to represent all of our members honestly and fairly. Thank you in advance for your support.

The number of unpaved roads in the community continues to decrease! This year funds are available and the Board approved paving the following roads; Whipple Way, Walton Way, Witherspoon and Stockton. In addition to the new paving repairs were approved for the intersection of Seneca and Overbrook, Sandy Pine and Beaver Run. Repair work began in July. The cost of the work is estimated to be in excess of 200,000.00. Despite heavy rains in July creating a set back with road preparation by our Maintenance Department they were able to prepare Sandy Pine and widen Stockton in between the storm days. Please use caution when passing work areas and obey all directions by workers. They do their best to keep disruption to a minimum. Thanks.

CONASHAUGH NEWS CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2017 PAGE 9 CONASHAUGH NEWS Storm Preparedness Summer is a promissory note signed in June, its long days spent and gone before you know it, and due to be repaid next January. Hal Borland We are on the horizon of fall and the winter is not far behind. Now is a good time to prepare for the weather that may accompany those seasons. With the presence of enhanced weather tracking devices and forecasts we get a pretty good running start on storms. Unfortunately many people wait until the last minute to start readying for such events. Ready.gov is a website full of many helpful tips for preparedness. Preparing your home and family for events including but not limited to active shooter, fl oods, hurricanes and other severe weather are covered on the site. If you are new to this area it is important to be aware of what happens when there is a power outage. Keep in mind that here we have onsite sewage and water. No electric equals no water or septic pump. Even if you took the precaution of fi lling your tub to fl ush your toilet you should not fl ush continuously, only when absolutely necessary. If your septic pump is out and you continue to fl ush you may end up with a backup into your home. Not pretty and most likely not covered and, if so, very limited by insurance. During power outages the compactors will be shut down. We cant compact trash without power. Our gate system automatically places gates in the open position. In extraordinary, extended outages gates can blocked. Take a look at the trees on your property. Do you have limbs or trees that pose a hazard to you or your neighbors home? Will your tree or dead branches drop on wires or in the road? Dont wait until a storm is blowing northward to start shopping for a tree company to help you. While you do not need a permit to trim branches, one is needed for tree removal. If you have trees to remove identify them with ribbon or tape no paint and contact the office for an inspection. Maintenance will inspect the trees and upon approval we will issue a permit. Maintenance does not remove trees from private properties in the community. If you have trees or branches that pose a hazard to electric wires you may want to call MetEd to see if they can send a tree company to evaluate and possibly remove that hazard. When a storm is approaching we make every eff ort to keep our members informed. Messages are sent via the LOOP and Facebook. If you are not on the LOOP and would like to join, send an email requesting to be added to CLCALOOPPTD.NET. Ready.gov materials pamphlets are available at the office. Family Communication Plans are also available. It is basically a form to collect important information and keep handy in the event of an emergency. Feel free to stop by the office to pick some up. It is up to everyone to realize they need to take responsibility for their familys protection andor own safety. Be aware of what you need to do to ensure that happens....

CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2017 PAGE 19 OUTDOOR  RECREATION Free fertilizer. Its in your yard in abundance this fall in the form of fallen leaves. Crisp, crunchy autumn leaves are a goldmine for your lawn or garden. Leaves add phosphorous, carbon, potassium and other nutrients to the soil; feed earthworms and boost the soils microbial life; increase the soils ability to retain water; and improve the soil structure. Fallen leaves make a great mulch that helps suppress weeds, protects plants over winter and at the same time fertilize the soil as the leaves break down. Why spend money on mulch and fertilizer? You can make your own with one of the very best sources of organic matter: autumn leaves. Creating leaf mulch for your lawn or garden is a great example of sustainable, organic and easy gardening. To create leaf mulch from your autumn leaves set your lawn mower on its highest setting without the bag and run over the leaves twice, this will break them down into small pieces. When Put Fall Leaves to Work BY: MARYANN LAJOUX leaves are broken up into smaller pieces, they gradually break down and make their way down into the grass where they provide mulch. This increases the surface area, giving microbes many more places to work. It prevents the leaves from packing together into layers that wont let water or air penetrate. And it reduces the volume of leaves dramatically. Every couple of weeks, continue to mow your leaves until they are finished falling. Youll be surprised at how quickly they disappear from the lawn surface as they break down. Then leave a light layer of shredded leaves on your lawn. As the leaves and grass clippings break down over the winter, they will add carbon, nitrogen and other substances to enrich your soil. All of this is vital to rapid recovery and regrowth in spring while needing less supplemental fertilizer. Fertilize your flower beds and feed your shrubs and trees with shredded leaves. This will improve the soil and protect your flower beds, shrubs and trees over winter. Spread no more than a 2-3 layer of chopped leaves around them being careful to keep the mulch from touching the stems and trunks of the plants themselves. Additional benefits of mulching: protects roots from winter cold, reduces heaving in small plants roots are forced up out of soil by alternate freezing and thawing, reduces soil erosion and prevents disease by keeping plant leaves from touching the soil. As the temperatures begin to cool and the first brightly colored leaves begin to fall, leave the rake in the shed and reach for your lawn mower  youll end up with a healthier lawn and garden with much less effort. So, are you ready to mow your leaves instead of raking them this fall?? Happy Gardening from the Ladybug Thank you to member Dave Westerfer for donating his time and talent creating the beautiful planters at our gates for all to enjoy. We have received so much wonderful feedback about them. Thanks again! CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2017 PAGE 20",

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20172018 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 30 th and coincidentally is the last day of the CLCA Fiscal Year. The meeting will be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Light refreshments will be served. All members will receive a ballot to vote in the mail. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned. For example if two people together own fi ve properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office.",

In case anyone is wondering, yes, we do contact the police and yes, they do respond and help us. If you are a follower of our Facebook Page you may occasionally see a post where it is announced that we are looking for someone who broke a gate. Included in these posts are the date, location, general vehicle description and time of the incident. Specifics such as the plate number and make and model of the vehicle are not announced as we do not want people taking these matters into their own hands. People have asked why this information is posted andor why we just dont call the police immediately. There are a number of reasons. As you may or may not be aware, there is limited police presence in these parts. Outside of a couple of private police departments, PSP Blooming Grove is responsible for covering Pike County in its entirety, including Interstate 84. That is a huge territory and the Troopers are stretched pretty thin. If we are able to pinpoint who breaks our gate without police involvement, we will handle the matter independently with the actor. It is our hope that an actor will learn of us knowing what they did through the Facebook post, and come forward. Five to seven days are usually given before the police are contacted. We have had some success with gate breakers coming forward without having to chase them or call the police. Sometimes, there are explanations as to why this happened. Some of those explanations are very creative while others are well, not so much. The PS Troopers have been very helpful in working with us in these matters and we are appreciative of their assistance. How do I get into the Community if I dont have my card? As a reminder all property owners are issued numbers unique to their property for use at the telepad. In the event that you are outside the gate without a gate card or someone home to let you inside you can use the number assigned to your property by dialing 0001 from the telepad. Keep the number in your wallet or car so that it is with you in the event that you need it. The number is for use by members only and not for sharing with contractors, friends or others. If you have any questions or do not know your propertys assigned number, call the office and we will be glad to help you. Hello and Welcome To... There have been a number of home sales in the Community over the last several months. A big welcome to our newest members including Ralph Guarino who arrived in March from East Islip, NY; Bob and Shannon Hazard along with their children Jaxson, Cecelia, Max and Elijah from New Jersey joined us in June and Davy and Debbie Washburn who along with their children Kayley, Jonathan, Alleigh, Samuel, Warren and Titus traveled over from Matamoras, Pa to live here. We wish you much happiness and joy in your new homes.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2017 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION Trash News As of July 1 2017 County Waste became our new trash and recycling hauler. County Waste has been a service company in this area for several years. In addition to working with us for dumpster day, they came highly recommended by a number of communities and townships that have been receivers of their services. Trash and Recycling Hourssubject to change Trash: Monday through Friday - 7:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday - 10:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. Recycling: The number of bins has increased to four. Bins are emptied on Mondays and Thursdays. That schedule is subject to change due to holidays. Our new recycling bins have deposit slots on the back which allows deposit 247. The large lids on top of the bins are unlocked until dusk to allow for convenient deposit of your recyclables. Unfortunately, some folks have used the recycling bins for disposal of trash and on one occasion a hot tub. If activity such as this continues, we will have no alternative other than to keep the top lids of the bins locked at all times. Recycling is single stream. You do not have to separate items. Please, please, please, DO NOT place Styrofoam or plastic bags in the recycle bins. Styrofoam needs to be thrown in the compactor. There is a trash bin at recycling for your plastic bags. Please fl atten your boxes. Placing intact boxes takes up unnecessary space and causes the bins to become full quickly. Recycling saves the community money. Recycling is done at a flat rate. We are charged by the ton for compactor trash. Compactor Dos and Donts: The compactor is for household trash. Household trash is not everything from your house. It includes refuse which comes from the bathroom and kitchen of a house like organic waste, food scraps, non-recyclable food and product containers, etc. Many of us came from areas where trash was picked up curbside. You would not put a bicycle, tires, wall to wall carpet or two by fours from a demolition at the curb with your trash cans. It is likely a special pick up would be in order. Our compactors are the same. Larger items need to be held for Dumpster Day or take them to the dump. Compactors are not for cleaning out your house when you are moving. Rent a dumpster. Do close the compactor doors after depositing your trash to prevent entry by animals. Do not leave trash or recyclables on the ground. With fi nes up to 500.00, it can cost you big time. There are phone numbers to call. During business hours call the office 686-4000. Outside of business hours call Security dispatch 1-800-916-7501 and request that the officer on duty report to the compactor area. Attention members who bring five or more bags of trash at a time andor fill the bin in one visit, dont jam your trash in the bin and slam the door to keep it there only to fall on the next person who opens the door. Not very pleasant. If you are going to hoard your trash and cram the compactor please have the courtesy to call for the trash to be compacted. The weekends are busy at the compactor. On Saturdays and Sundays there is a part time attendant on duty. Pete keeps the trash compacted late mornings and early afternoons. He also helps to keep unwanted items from being thrown into the compactors. He has a job. Please do not harass him or give him a hard time because you do not want to follow instructions, cant read signs or dont give a hoot. Last but not least. Do not allow friends, outsiders, non-members passage into Conashaugh for the purpose of depositing their trash. If this is discovered 1. You will be fined for illegal dumping up to 300.00; 2. If they use a card assigned to you add an additional 500.00 fi ne; 3. Your guest will be reported to the police for theft of services. Plain and simple. Dont do it. Thank you to our members who respect our trash rules and take the time to notify us of conditions and situations that need attention andor action. Not as simple as thought: A number of you if not most are wondering, hey when is the compactor moving? The plan has not been scrapped but after much thought and review it is a little more than just picking up the cans and putting them elsewhere. It is a project that needs to be done correctly and appears to need more review, possibly from an engineer. The project continues to be worked on and progressplans will be reported as they occur. Thank you for your patience. The next CLCA Dumpster Day will be held Saturday, October 7th from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m. Watch for details. Please note that all loose debris must be bagged and nails removed from wood. Loads not meeting these requirements will be rejected. SCHOOL IS OPEN Please Drive Carefully Monday August 28th is the first day of school. Some friendly bus stop reminders:  Please allow ample time to travel to the bus stop  Follow all travel direction signs in the lot  Speed limit in the parking lot is 5mph  Park in one space  Do not park in aisles  Young riders should be accompanied by parents guardians to their buses  Do not release or pick up children at the main entranceexit areas The parking lot procedures for afternoon pick up for elementary school buses are still in effect. All vehicles must be parked and not moving when buses for the el- ementaryprimary school are present in the afternoon. There are number of new families in our community and others new to the bus stop experience. Please be courteous and helpful to others.

Annette Musano, Dawn, Angelina and Isabel Amadore for picking up trash from our roads on Earth Day! Neil Johnson, Fred Kline, Eddie Calabrese, Joe Kistle, Larry Farnum, Bill King, David Weed and Scott Bailey for volunteering and working with our Maintenance staff to keep the garbage moving at the Spring Dumpster Day. Alain and Maryann Lajoux for pruning our plants at the front sign. Dave Westerfer for creating lovely planters at our entrances. For all of our volunteers who work to keep Conashaugh a nice place to live! CLCA ELECTIONS NEIL JOHNSON I have been a full time Conashaugh resident since 2001 and have held a number of Board positions including President on and off since 2002. I have participated in a number of volunteer positions including cooking for the CLCA Annual Picnic, Dumpster Day, CLCA Fishing Day and Halloween Patrols. Committees that I have been involved with include Security, Maintenance, Recreation, Environmental and Design Review. Conashaugh has grown over the years and is one of the most desirable Communities in this area. My wish is to continue contributing to keep our Community on this positive track. Thank you for your vote this election. Neil Johnson JOHN MCCAULEY I have been a full time resident for almost thirty years and a property owner a few years longer. I have taken my time on the Board several times over the years. As a matter of fact I served as President two years, Vice President two years, all while working a full time job. I also have served on several diff erent Committees over the years. I am currently retired from my full time job however, I am still an active volunteer as a District Commissioner for the Boy Scouts and a proud member of the Knights of Columbus. These activities are to benefi t our overall community and I hope to be an asset to CLCA. I believe that many of the rules and regulations need to be either updated or eliminated to reflect the current times. While the history of Conashaugh is rich in volunteer eff orts, and we as a Community need to be both proud and thankful for that, we also need to keep the tradition going. The bottom line is what we do as a Community we do for ourselves. I hope to represent all of our members honestly and fairly. Thank you in advance for your support. John McCauley Next DUMPSTER DAY Saturday October 7 th 8 a.m. till 3 p.m.",

The number of unpaved roads in the community continues to decrease! This year funds are available and the Board approved paving the following roads; Whipple Way, Walton Way, Witherspoon and Stockton. In addition to the new paving repairs were approved for the intersection of Seneca and Overbrook, Sandy Pine and Beaver Run. Repair work began in July. The cost of the work is estimated to be in excess of 200,000.00. Despite heavy rains in July creating a set back with road preparation by our Maintenance Department they were able to prepare Sandy Pine and widen Stockton in between the storm days. Please use caution when passing work areas and obey all directions by workers. They do their best to keep disruption to a minimum. Thanks.

Hal Borland We are on the horizon of fall and the winter is not far behind. Now is a good time to prepare for the weather that may accompany those seasons. With the presence of enhanced weather tracking devices and forecasts we get a pretty good running start on storms. Unfortunately many people wait until the last minute to start readying for such events. Ready.gov is a website full of many helpful tips for preparedness. Preparing your home and family for events including but not limited to active shooter, fl oods, hurricanes and other severe weather are covered on the site. If you are new to this area it is important to be aware of what happens when there is a power outage. Keep in mind that here we have onsite sewage and water. No electric equals no water or septic pump. Even if you took the precaution of fi lling your tub to fl ush your toilet you should not fl ush continuously, only when absolutely necessary. If your septic pump is out and you continue to fl ush you may end up with a backup into your home. Not pretty and most likely not covered and, if so, very limited by insurance. During power outages the compactors will be shut down. We cant compact trash without power. Our gate system automatically places gates in the open position. In extraordinary, extended outages gates can blocked. Take a look at the trees on your property. Do you have limbs or trees that pose a hazard to you or your neighbors home? Will your tree or dead branches drop on wires or in the road? Dont wait until a storm is blowing northward to start shopping for a tree company to help you. While you do not need a permit to trim branches, one is needed for tree removal. If you have trees to remove identify them with ribbon or tape no paint and contact the office for an inspection. Maintenance will inspect the trees and upon approval we will issue a permit. Maintenance does not remove trees from private properties in the community. If you have trees or branches that pose a hazard to electric wires you may want to call MetEd to see if they can send a tree company to evaluate and possibly remove that hazard. When a storm is approaching we make every eff ort to keep our members informed. Messages are sent via the LOOP and Facebook. If you are not on the LOOP and would like to join, send an email requesting to be added to CLCALOOPPTD.NET. Ready.gov materials pamphlets are available at the office. Family Communication Plans are also available. It is basically a form to collect important information and keep handy in the event of an emergency. Feel free to stop by the office to pick some up. It is up to everyone to realize they need to take responsibility for their familys protection andor own safety. Be aware of what you need to do to ensure that happens....

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2017 PAGE 19 OUTDOOR  RECREATION Free fertilizer. Its in your yard in abundance this fall in the form of fallen leaves. Crisp, crunchy autumn leaves are a goldmine for your lawn or garden. Leaves add phosphorous, carbon, potassium and other nutrients to the soil; feed earthworms and boost the soils microbial life; increase the soils ability to retain water; and improve the soil structure. Fallen leaves make a great mulch that helps suppress weeds, protects plants over winter and at the same time fertilize the soil as the leaves break down. Why spend money on mulch and fertilizer? You can make your own with one of the very best sources of organic matter: autumn leaves. Creating leaf mulch for your lawn or garden is a great example of sustainable, organic and easy gardening. To create leaf mulch from your autumn leaves set your lawn mower on its highest setting without the bag and run over the leaves twice, this will break them down into small pieces. When Put Fall Leaves to Work BY: MARYANN LAJOUX leaves are broken up into smaller pieces, they gradually break down and make their way down into the grass where they provide mulch. This increases the surface area, giving microbes many more places to work. It prevents the leaves from packing together into layers that wont let water or air penetrate. And it reduces the volume of leaves dramatically. Every couple of weeks, continue to mow your leaves until they are finished falling. Youll be surprised at how quickly they disappear from the lawn surface as they break down. Then leave a light layer of shredded leaves on your lawn. As the leaves and grass clippings break down over the winter, they will add carbon, nitrogen and other substances to enrich your soil. All of this is vital to rapid recovery and regrowth in spring while needing less supplemental fertilizer. Fertilize your flower beds and feed your shrubs and trees with shredded leaves. This will improve the soil and protect your flower beds, shrubs and trees over winter. Spread no more than a 2-3 layer of chopped leaves around them being careful to keep the mulch from touching the stems and trunks of the plants themselves. Additional benefits of mulching: protects roots from winter cold, reduces heaving in small plants roots are forced up out of soil by alternate freezing and thawing, reduces soil erosion and prevents disease by keeping plant leaves from touching the soil. As the temperatures begin to cool and the first brightly colored leaves begin to fall, leave the rake in the shed and reach for your lawn mower  youll end up with a healthier lawn and garden with much less effort. So, are you ready to mow your leaves instead of raking them this fall?? Happy Gardening from the Ladybug Thank you to member Dave Westerfer for donating his time and talent creating the beautiful planters at our gates for all to enjoy. We have received so much wonderful feedback about them. Thanks again!",

Power started on and off around 9:30 a.m. until it totally went out at approximately 10:50 a.m. on March 2nd and remained out until the early morning of March 7th. We lost power again in maintenance and at the back gate areas on March 8th until the late morning of March 10th. The community at large lost total power on Friday March 9th at approximately 4 p.m. for several hours due to motor vehicle accident that took down a pole during a snow squall. Phone service was intermittent at best, anything involving cable was out totally. Cell service was poor to fair for some carriers and zero for others. Once it was safe to travel, updates following the storm were made via our Facebook page. Updates included weather, area conditions, electrical work progress, outages, garbage alternatives and announcements regarding warming stations in the area. There was no access to The Loop. The original and subsequent storm forced the cancellations of a number of meetings including the open Board Meeting scheduled for March 10th. While there were noted attempts of thefts of generators and fuel posted in other areas, we received only one report of what could have been someone attempting to steal gas from a car on Overbrook. No gas was reportedly stolen but the member found their gas cap on the ground in the morning. There were no other reports made to the office or security. Well check requests came in via messenger on Facebook and the Pike County Communications Center. The needed checks were completed and members and their families updated. Due to the conditions, Security was excused from the site on Friday during the storm, Saturday the 3rd and again Wednesday during the second storm. Conditions on the roads to the community were hazardous and not conducive for travel within the community during the storms. Sadly one of our members lost their home to a severe chimney fire. Thankfully no one was injured in the blaze. Despite a huge effort by the Dingman Volunteer FD, the house received extensive damage. A number of members took advantage of the temporary shelter and offerings of meals and showers by the Fire Department. Quite a few residents left the community to stay in hotels and at the homes of friends and relatives. Despite some extremely challenging weather conditions the maintenance workers received many compliments concerning their job cleaning up the community. Posts on Facebook were very positive and complimentary of our workers who like our members were faced with power loss at their own homes and challenges navigating roads outside the community to get here and work. A temporary dumpster was brought in to the maintenance yard due the power outages. The dumpster was a welcome addition allowing members to dispose of the added trash from their non-working freezers and refrigerators. County Waste responded quickly to our request for the dumpster and its removal when it became full. POST STORM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT Dave and I attended a seminar at the Pike County Emergency Center on April 12, 2018. The forum presented an opportunity to discuss emergency response by the County, State, Penn Dot and Public Utilities due to Storms Riley and Quinn. The storm of March 2, 2018 was one of the worst storms to affect Pike County. Though it was predicted to only have a minor affect here with a majority of the storm affecting areas south of us, the storm had major affects on the entire county. Topics discussed were informative. For example Verizon lines as went down within 8 hours due to battery back-ups running out of power. Answers were provided to questions why some roads didnt get plowed. While it is obvious that Pike EOC was on board and ready to help, their hands were tied in cases where their work couldnt proceed without the co-operation of all public utilities. Restrictions on what and how the National Guard can actually do were enlightening. Availability and assistance provided by DCNRSaw Teams was all new information. Most in attendance at the meeting were municipality personnel, police, Politicians, governmental and emergency agencies. This meeting was advertised by Pike Emergency Management on Facebook and shared on our Facebook page and open to everyone. Everyone in attendance introduced themselves and interestingly one person identified himself as an interested civilian. In Like a Lion and Stayed Like a Boss CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Anyone living here can attest to the fact that weve seen some wild weather this year. Heavy snow and windstorms in early March, severe lightning and heavy rain in late July were some of the treats mother nature bestowed upon us. There are a number of ways to keep informed of weather events in the area. Conditions are posted when possible on the Conashaugh Lakes Community Association Facebook page. Unfortunately when weather hits the first thing to go is the power and our office equipment including pcs which makes it impossible to post information via the LOOP. If you are on Facebook you can also keep up with conditions on the Dingmans FerryMilford Road Page and Supporting Local Communities. Be aware however, that if there is an area-wide catastrophe resulting in power outages the administrators may not have the means to post updates. The March storm that knocked out power in our Community for five days also resulted in no internet or phones including cell phones. There is also an emergency notification system up and running in Pike County. It is called CODE RED. Stay informed of emergency situations or critical area alerts. Examples include: evacuation notices, severe weather, bio-terrorism alerts, boil water notices, and missing child reports. Notices are sent your cellphone and email. The link to enroll in CODE RED: https:public.coderedweb.comcneen-US BF92C048CF84 The CODE RED notification system works. It is highly recommended for everyone including those who reside or work out of this area and need to know conditions here before venturing this way during a weather emergency. Be Informed of Area Emergencies BY VALERIE FERLAUTO How did you survive the storms of 2018? Did you check in on a neighbor? Or did you stay home under the blankets and eat your way thru your pantry of chocolate? Did you shovel for the first few storms and then to hell with it for the rest, you would wait for the big thaw? Did your driveway get completely and neatly cleaned for the first few storms and all the ones after just a path for the car and maybe a small walkway to the front door? When the electricity went out did you have a generator? Did you run it twenty-four seven? Or did you conserve your gas because you thought you would never get to 739 to buy more? Did you run out of gas for your generator and try to syphon from your car? Did everything begin to smell like gas? And did you miss the smell when you no longer were filling that damn generator every few hours? Better yet, were you one of the many who decided to burn all those Pike County Couriers that you never recycled to keep the house warm? After the garbage piled up for a few days did you decide to make heat with it? After all smelly fireplace garbage heat is better than no heat. Were you adventurous enough to get in the car Stormy 2018 and go somewhere out of the dark and into the light? Even if only to charge your phone, catch up on texts, communicate with family and friends who thought you died and get some WiFi? Oh data how I missed you so! Maybe just sit somewhere, anywhere, without those seven layers of clothing and eat a hot cooked meal. But when the electricity came on, there was nothing better than being home cooking a real meal in your own kitchen. When did you realize your phone didnt work? Did you miss it or enjoy the quiet for a few days? When cable went out did you catch up on your reading? After all, dont you have a collection of Pike County Couriers sitting on a chair in the dining room collecting dust? Did you pull some craft project out of the back of a closet and craft away? Did you pull out the BBQ and start cooking everything in your freezer? Invite the neighbors over for pot luck? OR did you decide not to open the freezer door because the stench was going to make you sick? Those bear came out early this year, I wonder if they knew people would be leaving their garbage outside, in their sheds or cars and they wanted to enjoy the goodness of our moment of insanity. Were you one of the people that ran to family or friends in New Jersey or New York? Bet you couldnt wait to come home to The Beautiful Poconos, there is no place like home! Facebook! Did you miss it? Or did you realize that you wasted too many hours on it and never went back to it? Social Media, we can all learn to live without the media part and become more social with real people in real social atmospheres. Did you begin to notice that people werent combing their hair, putting on makeup and were out and about in what could have been their PJs.? Did you notice that no one cared after a while? Did you wake up every morning to see if the electricity came back on? And if it didnt, roll over and get a few minutes more of that wonderful, warm under the covers, sleep? Did you begin to realize that sleeping was so much better for you without that damn heat? Did you flush your toilet with lake water? Did you worry about your well and septic? Or did you just say, what will be, will be? When the electricity came back what was the first thing you did? Shower with hot water? Dance naked in front of your home? Promise yourself that you did without for so long that you were going to keep the temperature in your home a few degrees lower for infinity and beyond? Throw in a load of laundry? Put on the TV? Call someone who you thought didnt know it came back on? How long was it on before you knew? I wonder how many babies we will see in nine months in Pike County? Shop Local SUPPORT THE LOCAL BUSINESSES FEATURED IN THE CONASHAUGH COURIER CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 4 2018 has been a busy year for Conashaugh. We welcome the many new members who have purchased homes. The sales of homes in our community show that properties for sale due to foreclosure as well as by owners, continue in a positive direction. TRASH On January 27th a volunteer collected 7 12 bags of trash on Conashaugh Trail, Seneca Drive, Seneca Court, Overbrook Run and Iroquois Trail. A prior road clean up on the Friday and Monday after Thanksgiving yielded two pick- up truckloads of bags. Thank you to Members Roy Gottlieb, Jean Forichon, Stevie and Heather Hamilton, Elizabeth Torma, Justin Guyre and Ray and Jonathon Morales who volunteered and cleaned up roadsides and common areas during our Clean-up day on May 5th. At least 32 bags of trash were Office Notes BY: JEANNE CALABRESE collected by these volunteers. Dumpster Day was also held May 5th. Thank you to volunteers Fred Kline, Neil Johnson, Larry Farnum, Ed Calabrese and Brian Hamilton who along with our Maintenance employees emptied vehicles of 14.78 tons of trash. Records show that the month of April had the highest amount of compactor trash hauled since County Waste became our service provider. A total of 46.90 tons of trash was removed. Typical month hauls range between 25 and 35 tons with higher amounts around Christmas. COMPACTOR PROJECT-RESUMED July 5th a meeting was held with an engineer who designed and built a Compactor area for the Pocono Woodlands Community. We reviewed design and function for the area. The engineer will propose two costs one for Design only and the other for Design and Build. After much thought and consideration it was best felt that this project be overseen by an engineer. SALVATION ARMY COLLECTION We held our first on site collection on May 5th. Ellen Long and her staff were set up in the bus parking lot and collected a box truck of donations. They were very impressed with the amount of donations collected and very appreciative. Due to the success of this collection we will hold another on Saturday, October 20th. VEHICLES In February our 2007 F550 suffered damage when a pulley broke and ended up behind a balancer. The truck required a front motor cover, turbo intake, hose and radiator hose. It was repaired and returned to service. 2008 F550 The 2008 F550 has been a drain on our vehicle maintenance budget and staff over the past two years. In March it suffered damage to a u-joint. Repairs were completed for that damage and the vehicle was put up for sale. After three months it was sold for 8500.00 and limped out of here forever. 2010 FREIGHTLINER- This vehicle lost its 4 wheel drive while plowing Christmas Eve night. Due to the holiday and with suppliers either closed or low staffed, there was a delay in obtaining parts for the repair. Due to demand for this truck in the winter, wheel chains were used until the coast was clear from snow. NEW VEHICLE PURCHASED A 2018 GMC Sierra was purchased and up-fitted with a dump body and plow. The vehicle was purchased from Schwarz GMC and up-fitted by Bonham Road Supplies and Equipment, both of Honesdale, PA. The vehicle has a Duramax 6.6L Turbo Diesel V8 and was picked up on April 20th. The cost of the new vehicle and equipment was 81,097.62. Funds from the CLCA General Reserve were used to make this purchase. PHONE SYSTEM Due to increasing costs and lack of features available for those costs, our phone system was changed from Verizon to Blue Ridge this past April. Software glitches with our tele-pad system required that line to be returned to Verizon. Members have inquired about using their cell phones for the tele pad. Unfortunately only home lines and cell phones with a local exchange continue to be the only lines that work with the tele pad. We have found that some members were able to switch their homeland line numbers to their cell phones and successfully eliminate their home lines and use their cell for the tele pad. If you currently have a land line and a cell phone, you may want to call your cellphone provider to see if the land line number can be switched out with your cell. There may be a one-time charge for this service and you will no longer have your cell number. GOVERNORS CABINET MEETINGS On Feb 1st a meeting called The Cabinet in the Community was held at Wallenpaupack HS. Four secretaries from Governor Wolf s cabinet were on hand to address questions. Representatives from the DEP, Department of Aging, Department of Agriculture and Department of Health were on hand. The seminar was informative. One item of particular interest that was discussed is the presence of an insect that is a threat to agriculture. There have been no reported sightings of this insect in Pike County, however there was one sighting in Monroe. Maintenance Foreman Dave also learned about these insects as they were a very hot topic of discussion during Arborist classes he attended in January.

Each year an audit of Conashaughs Finances is conducted by Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska. The audit is very thorough and detailed. It begins in November and continues through late winter. A copy of the Financial report is available at the CLCA Office for review. ALL CLEAR! In May the septic tanks for the Rec Building and Office were pumped. No issues found. STORM WATER MANAGEMENT On May 15th Dave and I attended a Good Practices for Storm Water Management seminar. This was a free seminar facilitated by the Pike County Conservation Department and included visits to 4 facilities to observe good storm water control. Retention ponds, rain gardens and more sophisticated drainage and cistern systems were exhibited. Also included and very interesting were samplings of asphalt and concrete surfaces that are permeable allowing water to seep rather than run off to adjacent areas. It was a very interesting and worthwhile seminar. COLLECTIONS: In November 2017, twelve accounts were referred to Attorney Farleys office for collection. Five of the twelve referred accounts were paid by the owners before legal action commenced. The remaining seven accounts were referred to the Magistrate for Judgements to be filed. Judgements are then filed with the Prothonotarys office and remain on file for five years or until the judgment is paid. Judgments are renewable after the five year time period. JUDICIAL SALE. April 25th there were a total of 9 CLCA properties up for sale for non-payment of taxes. No bids were made on the properties during the live auction. On Saturday July 14, 2018 the Board of Directors voted unanimously to make the following change to the CLCA RulesFine associated with the use of fireworks within the community. First Offense - 500.00 Second Offense - 1000.00 A discussion included what constitutes fireworks. Fireworks include PROJECTILES ie roman candles, bottle rockets, mortars and EXPLOSIVE fireworks such as fire crackers, M-80s, cherry bombs etc. Fireworks do not include sparklers, snakes, poppers, small novelty varieties. Basically if it flies in the air andor explodes it is not permitted. Filing a Complaint: While it is not our goal to have members battling members over violations, some are pushed beyond their patience and need an outlet to have a violation addressed. Enforcement can also be accomplished when a formal, written complaint is filed with the office. If you wish to file a formal complaint it must be done in writing with the office by completing a complaint form or sending an email. Complainants need to contain specific facts including date, time and location as in address, of the violation. Complaints must be signed in hand or electronically. Anonymous complaints will not be accepted. Valid complaints will result in a citation being issued to the violators. In the event that the violator contests the citation whether it resulted from Security citation or from a formal complaint they are entitled to a hearing. Due process is owed to anyone issued a violation. In the event that the citation is contested, the complainant should be prepared to provide testimony for a hearing. It is important to know that the burden of proof that a violation has occurred is on the CommunitySecurity andor the Complainant. Any additional evidence supplied such as video, dash cam footage etc. will be beneficial in helping the Hearing Committee determine if the violation holds. Special Note Regarding Social Media: While posting on Facebook or other social media may provide individuals a place to vent or discuss concerns with other members it does not constitute a formal complaint. Response to Facebook posts may occur but should not be expected. MAINTENANCE SHOP FOUNDATION WALL Sometime in May it was noticed that the basement wall in the Maintenance shop was starting to bow. Two contractors were called in to provide bids on the repair. One contractor did not show up for two appointments. Cutting Edge Mason began repairs to the foundation of the building on June 14 and the job completed June 20th. The repair cost was 7480.98 plus an additional 250.00 for clean fill from DS Stone. We were fortunate that the existing footings did not have to be replaced which would have cost an additional 4300.00. Payment for these repairs were made from the General Reserve Account. ROAD PAVING 2018 During the month of June Dave met with Wayco representatives and reviewed roads that need to be repaired and roads to be paved. The Board approved and announced the following repairs and new paving during their July Meeting: IROQUOIS TRAIL FROM ONEIDA TO CONKLIN- REPAIR Roadway is badly worn and in need of repaving. Maintenance removed 4 aging culvert pipes from under Iroquois. 3 of the pipes have been replaced. The fourth was not a functional pipe. CONKLIN DRIVE- REPAIR Continuation of the above repairs.

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20182019 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 29th. The meeting will be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Refreshments will be served. All members will receive a ballot to vote. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail- in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office. Hello and Welcome! Conashaugh welcomes the Finegans.

Valerie Ferlauto CONASHAUGH LETTERS This community has meant a lot to me over the last 22 years. It has been a safe haven for my children to grow up in over the many fond years. My wish was during my time on the Board was to try to do the same for the future families as the boards before me did for mine. I will miss the small town feeling it has given me throughout the years. I truly hope that some new members rise up to the challenge that is before them. Our board is aging and needs the younger families to step up and take ownership. To my fellow board members....it has been a pleasure to serve with you. Thank you for your service, volunteerism and most of all your friendship. Thank you again for all of the great years and memories. You will all be missed but never forgotten. Respectfully yours, Michael P. Stevenson Picnic was great! Food and weather....perfect! Everyone did a great job putting it together. Thank you. Barbara  Bobby Next DUMPSTER DAY Saturday October 20 th 8 a.m. till 3 p.m. Hi, my name is Annette Musano. My family and I have been CLCA members since 2005. Last year at the annual meeting I was appointed to fill in the vacant slot as Rec Liaison and this year I am running for that position. Several years after moving into the community, I became active in helping out at Rec events on a regular basis. I later joined the Environmental Committee and functioned as their secretary for 3 years. Then in 2016 I became the assistant chair of the Rec Committee and we successfully resurrected and revamped some of the wonderful events done in the past with enthusiastic turnouts for the most part. The next year I acted as the chair and again we ran several successful events. I also have been part of the annual picnic committee for the past 10 years as I see the event as a fantastic way for neighbors to get together on a social basis and meet new CLCA members. A pet peeve of mine is keeping this community as pristine as nature intended it with total respect for our environment. I have written articles for the Courier regarding this and I m sure youve seen my son and I regularly picking up trash on the side of our roads. I would like to see a formal committee formed for that purpose. My husband and I chose Conashaugh over the other communities in the area based on its beauty, amenities, advice of realtors, the reputation of its members and those employees involved in the day to day operations of the community. We should be proud and grateful to live here and I would like to see that pride and sense of gratitude, care and concern for our members continue for years to come. I truly feel that the best way to be part of our wonderful community is to get involved and share your time and talents and I encourage all CLCA members to do so. Annette Musano Bill King I grew up on the tide waters of the Chesapeake Bay in southern Maryland, fishing, crabbing, hunting and farming. As a teenager I spent summers working on a tobacco farm during the day while catching and selling crabs early in the morning. Worked my way through college back in the days when you could do that, as an auto parts clerk, graduating from the University of Maryland. Ive been married 37 years to my wonderful, lovely, and patient have to be with me wife, Karen. We have two sons who have long since flown the nest and one grandson. We attend Milford Bible Church. Shortly after college I joined Motorola where I spent the next 27 years, primarily in their first responder communication sector. Leaving Motorola in 2006 I subsequently worked for two other companies based out of New Y ork City, Brookwood Companies Incorporated and The New Y ork City Leadership Center, Inc. Employment has kept my wife, Karen, and I moving around. Beginning with my home state of Maryland and her home state of Pennsylvania, we have also lived in the Chicago suburbs, Dallas area, south Florida, northern New Jersey, and New Y ork City. We hope to settle here in Conashaugh Lakes! In 2014, I semi-retired and we moved full time to Conashaugh Lakes. But in 2016 I was enticed back to work part-time for Brookwood Companies Incorporated a textile firm that specializes in military applications. My second time around with the company and a very long story. Karen and I love the wild life and serenity of the community. And have appreciated and found the majority of the residents to be good folks who really care about family, neighbors, community, and country. My biggest lesson learned over the years is to treat all people fairly, transparently, and truthfully. I may not agree with you, but I will listen to and respect your opinion.

Members posted photos on Facebook of our furry neighbors as they lumbered through yards and in some cases got a little too close for comfort. Bird feeders went missing, sheds were broken into and even car doors were opened by these clever tricksters. Bears in the compactor area, the tennis courts at the beach. For the first time in more than ten years they even ventured into the pool area resulting in short closure periods to allow them to be safely redirected. We received calls regarding bears along with calls for us to remove the bears. We live in an area populated with bears. We do not remove bears. We do encourage everyone to follow good practices to not attract bears to their properties. If a bear becomes a nuisance the Game Commission can be contacted. Their phone number is 570-675-1143 or 570-675-1144. If you call the Game Commission be ready to answer questions regarding what you are doing to prevent attracting bears to your property. Bears in your trees, walking through your yard or down a road are not considered nuisance bears. Tearing down bird feeders, eating garbage left outside in shedscarstruck beds or garages is not the bears fault. Theyre bears. They are clever opportunists. Dont give them opportunities and never feed them. You may or may not have heard the saying a fed bear is a dead bear. Think about that statement and realize the consequences that may occur if you are feeding bears. Bears by nature are fearful of humans. However, if you invite them to dine at your property, guess what, they keep coming back and then become a nuisance and possibly dangerous to not only you but other people. Feeding bears also subjects you to a hefty fine from the Pennsylvania Game Warden. Please dont do it. The following link is to the Pennsylvania Game Commission regarding living with these creatures. http:www.pgc.pa.govBlaPages LivingwithBlackBears.aspx Friendly Reminder If you are planning to pave your driveway, please contact the office for a no cost inspection by maintenance. This inspection is to determine if you need to install or replace a culvert pipe. Please do this in advance of arranging a date for paving. Thank you. This year we said good bye to some wonderful folks who moved on to new adventures. Mike Stevenson and John and Lynn McCauley all served on the CLCA Board of Directors during various times over many years. Mike sold his home and a second property this year and John and Lynn are enjoying well deserved retirement in North Carolina. Thank you all for your service at Conashaugh Lakes! Farewell and Thank You! CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 11 CLCA Pool The pool underwent major renovations over the course of last fall and this spring. A warmer and longer than usual fall allowed for construction to continue into November. However, winter extended her stay which resulted in a lot of nail biting and wondering if everything would be completed in time for opening day. For the past several years the pool deck had to be continuously jack hammered open to access and repair plumbing lines. It seemed that no sooner would a line be repaired, another one would break. All of this breakage resulted in a lot of water loss and having to top off the pool, as much as four inches per day plus a lot of maintenance repairs. An outside contractor was called in at one point to use leak seeking cameras to determine where leaks were happening. It was time to stop chasing these leaks and replace the original, forty plus year old plumbing. The estimated cost for the project was 83,000.00. Payments for the project were made from reserve money saved for the purpose of repairing, replacing and preserving our assets. The repair to the pool included removal and replacement of all the concrete decking surrounding the pool and plumbing for the filtration system. New features included a propane heater and new underwater LED lighting for the main pool and a water fountain feature for the baby pool. The main construction work was completed by Pro-Pools of Green Lane, Pa., the same company that installed the Delifol liner, tile work and new coping a few years ago. The heater was also purchased from Pro-Pools. Installation of the heater and the propane tanks needed to operate was completed by Bottini Fuels. All of the electrical work was performed by Leonard Boyle of Milford. It wouldnt be a project without a few hidden surprises. Len Boyle discovered some rodents made the pool service panel their home and dined on protective covering on wiring. Our last minute heroes were the volunteers from the Dingman Township Fire Department who with the assistance of a pumper truck, filled the pool with water from Seneca Lake. Their services saved the community a bundle of money. The one hundred thousand gallons needed to fill the pool would have taxed our well and the cost to buy water, well, that was just plain cost prohibitive. Maintenance did their magic and shocked and vacuumed the pool and while the heater was not ready for operation by opening day, an abundance of sunshine allowed water temperatures to reach to the mid-seventies. The pool opened as scheduled on the last day of school and we had an impressive turn out. Feedback from residents regarding the renovations and added features has been positive. The heater install was subsequently completed and thermostat for the pool heater has been set at a comfortable eighty degrees. Tanks supplying propane to the pool are independent from building heat tanks and the usage and costs are being monitored for future budgeting. The cost to date for this project is 75,208.00. We hope that many of the members here have taken some time to enjoy the pool this year. CONASHAUGH NEWS CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 12 CONASHAUGH NEWS On May 5th there were a number of events held for our members to de-clutter and donate unwanted items, rid their homes and properties of unwanted debris and tidy up the roads all in an effort to keep Conashaugh beautiful. Dumpster day volunteers worked alongside maintenance employees removing trash items from members vehicles. Meanwhile a Salvation Army Truck and volunteers were parked at the bus lot collecting all kinds of treasures. As this was all happening a bunch of volunteers worked picking up trash along our roads. A total of 14.78 tons of trash items were collected in three, thirty yard dumpsters in the maintenance yard. Time is precious and valuable. Thank you to all of our volunteers for donating theirs to minimize costs for these services. It is very much appreciated. Our next Dumpster Day will be held on Saturday, October 20th.

Salvation Army CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 14 BY VALERIE FERLAUTO Do you ever wonder how things get done around Conashaugh Lakes? I know some of you think that little elves come out at night and set up tents, tables and chairs. That wonderful foods materialize on said tables by magic. The reality is that events that happen here at Conashaugh Lakes are due to hours of preparation by volunteers, who begin months before any event takes place. Conashaugh Lakes Annual Community Picnic is one of those events. Here are some of the statistics that are used to measure some of the prior proper planning that goes into the event:  We are a community of seven hundred plus owners  392 people RSVPd for this years picnic  278 people actually showed up for the event  Approximately twenty-two people dedicated their time, energy, creativity and talents to planning and executing the Annual Picnic What do these statistics mean? Well for one, twenty-two of our fellow community members did the work for all 278 people in attendance. A big thank you to all of you who took the time away from your normal lives to dedicate yourselves to the rest of us. Y ou did an amazing job! I asked Patti Havecost why? Why volunteer to make this day happen? She told me that she has lived here for twenty nine years and she loves the sense of community that she gets from living here, especially at the Annual Picnic. Her thirty years working in the restaurant and catering industries were on point. If you were at the picnic and arent sure who Patti is, let me tell you, she was the tall blond managing the buffet area, with grace and expertise, a smile on her face and when she laughed, you knew she meant it because she has a sincere contagious laugh. She made sure that there was always plenty of HOT, yummy food available for our members. She told me that she loved standing there chit chatting with everyone as she constantly kept the buffet stocked and clean. The Annual Picnic Committee begins their planning several months before the picnic. Their meetings are open to everyone in our community. The core planners and shoppers for this years picnic were Annette Musano, Cindy Gomez, Ron and Elaine McDermott, Judy Weed, Patti Havekost, Jeanne Calabrese, Larry Farnum, Jean Forichon, Sally Yearwood and Ingrid Fox. The planning meetings were short and sweet which makes me wonder if they served any chocolate at these meetings? Everyone ran with their assigned tasks which included reserving tents, ordering food, hiring a DJ, advertising, co-ordinating with Maintenance, inventorying supplies on hand and buying what was needed. After the months of planning it is the week leading into the picnic that our volunteers put plans into action. Elaine and Ron McDermott graciously allow us to store, among other things, the beverages and coolers used at the picnic. They also provide all that HOT water that is used in the chaffing dishes to keep the food, well, hot. We are fortunate that they willingly open their garage to our community as it makes for a very easy move the day of the picnic. Jeanne, among the many other things she did for us, took the time to organize big plastic bins filled with pot holders, rubber gloves used in food prep, utensils, metal pans, chaffing dishes etc. When the picnic was over, she also took all of these things to her home and deep cleaned and washed everything so they are ready for our next event. Thank you to our Maintenance Men! A few days before the picnic they begin the process of preparing chairs, tables, BBQ and tents. A nice Power Wash, loading onto trucks and transporting to the lake, as well as breaking down at the end of the picnic and putting all nice and neatly away until our next event. At the time some of us were just sipping our first cup of coffee volunteers began to arrive at the scene. Some of our volunteers were already at the lake making sure everything was CLCA Annual Picnic Continued on Page 19 CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 15 CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 16 CONASHAUGH NEWS Heres a little history of the building that we anyone involved in the current renovations have come to know as the Wreck Building. While the exact age of the building is not readily available, an appraisal performed on it in 1991 estimated it to be twenty- one years old at that time. It was originally the sales office for CLCA. People would come and oooh and ahh at the lovely pool buy their land and get a free toaster. Im not sure prospective buyers were given a toaster but it was some kind of incentivethank you. Anyway, the structure was surrounded by a deck on three sides. Eventually with the growth of Conashaugh and the need for office space it was decided to enclose the rear deck facing the pool and side deck along Oneida way. From what information that can be gathered, this task was done lovingly by volunteers in the Community. Eventually CLCA purchased the property where the current office is located and the original office became the Rec Building. From archive photos it served the Community well for meetings, parties and even a snack stand and haunted house one Halloween. Fast forward to late summer 2016. Estimates were sought to install vinyl siding and some new rear windows for the building. Those estimates were for 31,050.00, 27,890.00 Rec Building and 20,187.00. The time was not right for that work so those estimates were put on the back burner to be revisited the following year. In the meantime the deck at the office was in dire need to be repaired and became the priority. That work was completed by Frank Gorman of FSG Siding and Decking, the contractor who is working at the Rec Building and coincidentally the contractor who provided the lowest bid for the Rec Building job. It should be noted that it wasnt only the number on the bid that got FSG the job but the beautiful and meticulous work on the deck for the office, also at a very good price. By early summer 2017 Frank began consulting on behalf of Conashaugh with Dingman Township regarding the proposed project and it was learned that we needed to include a handicap ramp for the entry. Easy peasy. Frank prepared a supplemental estimate for the ramp and submitted paperwork for the permit. On September 28th we received a letter denying our permit because the proposed ramp was less than 40 feet from the road. Considering the building is less than 40 feet from the road it was obvious that we go back to the drawing board to come up with a revised plan or pay an attorney and additional fees for a variance hearing. Frank came back with an alternative plan for the ramp and it was approved by the CLCA Board in October. The revised plans and permit for the project were approved by the Township November 6th. It should be noted that the contractor at this point had put in a lot of time on this project and had not received a dime. Meanwhile, thanks to stretch of better than anticipated weather our pool contractors were still working in the pool yard which was good for their project but further delayed the start of the Rec Building work. Once the pool contractors packed up their wares the Rec Building project began in mid-December with the removal and replacement of the back windows. January and February was when the real fun began. When the windows were removed it was discovered the walls werent insulated. Electrical outlets had to be moved, call the electrician. Easy! More windows were removed and guess what? Missing headers, improper framing and oh, mice ate the wiring. At this point it was decided to secure an estimate for new insulation and sheetrock for the ceiling and walls. The Board also approved to install a new HVAC unit. SOS Heating to the rescue. Time to get another permit! In between the demolition and installations, life went on in Conashaugh with Committee, Board and Scout meetings. Frank without complaint moved all of his tools and materials from one side of the building to the other to accommodate making space for these meetings. He even set up tables and he never complained when said meetings were cancelled. Exterior work began with the removal and replacement of the front steps which required footings. The existing steps were set on rocks, blobs of cement and even on dirt. Sheetrock removed by the front door revealed more electrical nightmares. Call back the electrician! Back to the sheetrock. Who knew the building is four inches lower on one side than the other? Time to get the jack and replace corner supports that were improperly installed on the Oneida side of the building. That post holding up the left side roof? It was rotted from the ground down to the non-existing footing which also allowed the left side deck to rise and fall with the temperatures over the years and pull the foundation. All of the aforementioned has been addressed. Then there was March. No need to repeat that nightmare but the reader should know that while we were lucky to have only five days without power, our contractor was one of the luckier ones to go without for eleven days. Spring and warm weather finally arrived sometime in May and then the pool guys had to come back into the yard with all of their equipment to finish pouring concrete. Exterior siding resumed. Ceiling and wall painting was not part of the estimates and completed by a volunteer on their week off from work. A new handicap accessible bathroom was added to the mix. Yes, its taken some time to complete renovations at the Rec Building. There are many who are looking forward to its completion. Frank may not be the fastest contractor but he is honest, reliable, helpful and accommodating. Although he occasionally has help he mostly works solo. At this point hes gone beyond working to correct the problems hes encountered. He didnt walk away. Someone else may have run in the other direction or go home one day and not come back or worse yet, covered the sins and say sayonara. There are plenty of pictures of all that is described. If you have doubt, feel free to request to see them. This project started at 20,187.00 for windows, siding and a deck. The additional work handicap ramp, extended rear deck, hc accessible bathroom, new insulation and sheetrock interior results in a revised estimate of approximately 39,000.00. This amount does not include electrical, HVAC, painting and finish flooring and cabinetry which are not included in the estimates and have or will be completed by others.We all look forward to its completion.

Have you heard of the spotted lanternfly? This pests potential to severely impact the agricultural and hardwood industries in Pennsylvania was discussed recently during a number of locally held Cabinet in your Community sessions. While there have been no reported sightings in this immediate area, thirteen Pennsylvania Counties are under quarantine for this insect. The closest county, Monroe, is right next door. As part of the quarantine the public is asked to look for and dispose of egg masses, check vehicles and campers for egg masses and insects before leaving a quarantined area. The public is also asked not to transport brush, yard or construction waste or firewood outside of quarantined areas. Spotted Lantern Fly Facts:  Invasive plant hopper Native to China, India and Vietnam  First detected in Berks County in 2014  Although they fly poorly they are better hoppers  It overwinters in egg masses laid on smooth bark, stone and other vertical surfaces including, but not limited to vehicles, yard furniture, campers and farm equipment.  Offspring emerge as white-spotted black nymphs in the late spring and then gain red patches over the next few months.

It was a welcome start after a long, not so nice winter. Thank you to all of the guys who each year put this event together and stock our lake for this event. CLCA Fishing Day OUTDOOR  RECREATION in place for us. Besides our Maintenance men, Larry Farnum, Neil Johnson, Ed Calabrese and Ed Kelly were all there making sure everything was in its place. Around eleven the Prime Time Convoy headed out to get the food! We had thirty five trays of hot food and eight huge boxes of hamburgers! YIKES! Thank you Patti Havekost, David Weed, Ron McDermott and Cindy Gomez. Annette Musano was our salad shopper, chopper and all day Samaritan. As well as one of the greeters at our welcome table. David and Judy Weed, Kim Decker, Ingrid Fox, Christina Villanueva and Cindy Gomez were at the scene setting up tables, laying down table clothes and lending help to make this day possible for all of us. Jasmine Drury put a smile on a lot of childrens faces with the Egg Hunt. Pete Denigris was on constant garbage duty as well as chief cheese placement for burgers. Kim Decker was a greeter at our welcome table. Six hours into our volunteers day, the Conashaugh Lakes Annual Community Picnic started! DJ played music, food was eaten and enjoyed, people danced, eggs were hunted and games were played! Five oclock arrived and our volunteers were still working, cleaning up and putting things away. They were lucky as a few members helped fold up tables, chairs and table clothes. Patti and Jeanne packed up the leftovers and the bins of supplies and brought them all back to the Rec Center. With the help of some of our pool staff, Nick Christianson and Vincent Hussey food has been properly frozen for use at the volunteer picnic. During the day many volunteers could be heard saying NEVER again! By seven oclock these same volunteers were laying plans for next years picnic, taking notes on what went well that they want to repeat and what they may leave out. My suggestion to you, thank our volunteers! Let them know you had a good time at our picnic. Volunteer yourself for our next event. All are welcome! My apologies to any volunteer I left out.

Power started on and off around 9:30 a.m. until it totally went out at approximately 10:50 a.m. on March 2nd and remained out until the early morning of March 7th. We lost power again in maintenance and at the back gate areas on March 8th until the late morning of March 10th. The community at large lost total power on Friday March 9th at approximately 4 p.m. for several hours due to motor vehicle accident that took down a pole during a snow squall. Phone service was intermittent at best, anything involving cable was out totally. Cell service was poor to fair for some carriers and zero for others. Once it was safe to travel, updates following the storm were made via our Facebook page. Updates included weather, area conditions, electrical work progress, outages, garbage alternatives and announcements regarding warming stations in the area. There was no access to The Loop. The original and subsequent storm forced the cancellations of a number of meetings including the open Board Meeting scheduled for March 10th. While there were noted attempts of thefts of generators and fuel posted in other areas, we received only one report of what could have been someone attempting to steal gas from a car on Overbrook. No gas was reportedly stolen but the member found their gas cap on the ground in the morning. There were no other reports made to the office or security. Well check requests came in via messenger on Facebook and the Pike County Communications Center. The needed checks were completed and members and their families updated. Due to the conditions, Security was excused from the site on Friday during the storm, Saturday the 3rd and again Wednesday during the second storm. Conditions on the roads to the community were hazardous and not conducive for travel within the community during the storms. Sadly one of our members lost their home to a severe chimney fire. Thankfully no one was injured in the blaze. Despite a huge effort by the Dingman Volunteer FD, the house received extensive damage. A number of members took advantage of the temporary shelter and offerings of meals and showers by the Fire Department. Quite a few residents left the community to stay in hotels and at the homes of friends and relatives. Despite some extremely challenging weather conditions the maintenance workers received many compliments concerning their job cleaning up the community. Posts on Facebook were very positive and complimentary of our workers who like our members were faced with power loss at their own homes and challenges navigating roads outside the community to get here and work. A temporary dumpster was brought in to the maintenance yard due the power outages. The dumpster was a welcome addition allowing members to dispose of the added trash from their non-working freezers and refrigerators. County Waste responded quickly to our request for the dumpster and its removal when it became full. POST STORM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT Dave and I attended a seminar at the Pike County Emergency Center on April 12, 2018. The forum presented an opportunity to discuss emergency response by the County, State, Penn Dot and Public Utilities due to Storms Riley and Quinn. The storm of March 2, 2018 was one of the worst storms to affect Pike County. Though it was predicted to only have a minor affect here with a majority of the storm affecting areas south of us, the storm had major affects on the entire county. Topics discussed were informative. For example Verizon lines as went down within 8 hours due to battery back-ups running out of power. Answers were provided to questions why some roads didnt get plowed. While it is obvious that Pike EOC was on board and ready to help, their hands were tied in cases where their work couldnt proceed without the co-operation of all public utilities. Restrictions on what and how the National Guard can actually do were enlightening. Availability and assistance provided by DCNRSaw Teams was all new information. Most in attendance at the meeting were municipality personnel, police, Politicians, governmental and emergency agencies. This meeting was advertised by Pike Emergency Management on Facebook and shared on our Facebook page and open to everyone. Everyone in attendance introduced themselves and interestingly one person identified himself as an interested civilian. In Like a Lion and Stayed Like a Boss",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Anyone living here can attest to the fact that weve seen some wild weather this year. Heavy snow and windstorms in early March, severe lightning and heavy rain in late July were some of the treats mother nature bestowed upon us. There are a number of ways to keep informed of weather events in the area. Conditions are posted when possible on the Conashaugh Lakes Community Association Facebook page. Unfortunately when weather hits the first thing to go is the power and our office equipment including pcs which makes it impossible to post information via the LOOP. If you are on Facebook you can also keep up with conditions on the Dingmans FerryMilford Road Page and Supporting Local Communities. Be aware however, that if there is an area-wide catastrophe resulting in power outages the administrators may not have the means to post updates. The March storm that knocked out power in our Community for five days also resulted in no internet or phones including cell phones. There is also an emergency notification system up and running in Pike County. It is called CODE RED. Stay informed of emergency situations or critical area alerts. Examples include: evacuation notices, severe weather, bio-terrorism alerts, boil water notices, and missing child reports. Notices are sent your cellphone and email. The link to enroll in CODE RED: https:public.coderedweb.comcneen-US BF92C048CF84 The CODE RED notification system works. It is highly recommended for everyone including those who reside or work out of this area and need to know conditions here before venturing this way during a weather emergency. Be Informed of Area Emergencies BY VALERIE FERLAUTO How did you survive the storms of 2018? Did you check in on a neighbor? Or did you stay home under the blankets and eat your way thru your pantry of chocolate? Did you shovel for the first few storms and then to hell with it for the rest, you would wait for the big thaw? Did your driveway get completely and neatly cleaned for the first few storms and all the ones after just a path for the car and maybe a small walkway to the front door? When the electricity went out did you have a generator? Did you run it twenty-four seven? Or did you conserve your gas because you thought you would never get to 739 to buy more? Did you run out of gas for your generator and try to syphon from your car? Did everything begin to smell like gas? And did you miss the smell when you no longer were filling that damn generator every few hours? Better yet, were you one of the many who decided to burn all those Pike County Couriers that you never recycled to keep the house warm? After the garbage piled up for a few days did you decide to make heat with it? After all smelly fireplace garbage heat is better than no heat. Were you adventurous enough to get in the car Stormy 2018 and go somewhere out of the dark and into the light? Even if only to charge your phone, catch up on texts, communicate with family and friends who thought you died and get some WiFi? Oh data how I missed you so! Maybe just sit somewhere, anywhere, without those seven layers of clothing and eat a hot cooked meal. But when the electricity came on, there was nothing better than being home cooking a real meal in your own kitchen. When did you realize your phone didnt work? Did you miss it or enjoy the quiet for a few days? When cable went out did you catch up on your reading? After all, dont you have a collection of Pike County Couriers sitting on a chair in the dining room collecting dust? Did you pull some craft project out of the back of a closet and craft away? Did you pull out the BBQ and start cooking everything in your freezer? Invite the neighbors over for pot luck? OR did you decide not to open the freezer door because the stench was going to make you sick? Those bear came out early this year, I wonder if they knew people would be leaving their garbage outside, in their sheds or cars and they wanted to enjoy the goodness of our moment of insanity. Were you one of the people that ran to family or friends in New Jersey or New York? Bet you couldnt wait to come home to The Beautiful Poconos, there is no place like home! Facebook! Did you miss it? Or did you realize that you wasted too many hours on it and never went back to it? Social Media, we can all learn to live without the media part and become more social with real people in real social atmospheres. Did you begin to notice that people werent combing their hair, putting on makeup and were out and about in what could have been their PJs.? Did you notice that no one cared after a while? Did you wake up every morning to see if the electricity came back on? And if it didnt, roll over and get a few minutes more of that wonderful, warm under the covers, sleep? Did you begin to realize that sleeping was so much better for you without that damn heat? Did you flush your toilet with lake water? Did you worry about your well and septic? Or did you just say, what will be, will be? When the electricity came back what was the first thing you did? Shower with hot water? Dance naked in front of your home? Promise yourself that you did without for so long that you were going to keep the temperature in your home a few degrees lower for infinity and beyond? Throw in a load of laundry? Put on the TV? Call someone who you thought didnt know it came back on? How long was it on before you knew? I wonder how many babies we will see in nine months in Pike County?

The sales of homes in our community show that properties for sale due to foreclosure as well as by owners, continue in a positive direction. TRASH On January 27th a volunteer collected 7 12 bags of trash on Conashaugh Trail, Seneca Drive, Seneca Court, Overbrook Run and Iroquois Trail. A prior road clean up on the Friday and Monday after Thanksgiving yielded two pick- up truckloads of bags. Thank you to Members Roy Gottlieb, Jean Forichon, Stevie and Heather Hamilton, Elizabeth Torma, Justin Guyre and Ray and Jonathon Morales who volunteered and cleaned up roadsides and common areas during our Clean-up day on May 5th. At least 32 bags of trash were Office Notes BY: JEANNE CALABRESE collected by these volunteers. Dumpster Day was also held May 5th. Thank you to volunteers Fred Kline, Neil Johnson, Larry Farnum, Ed Calabrese and Brian Hamilton who along with our Maintenance employees emptied vehicles of 14.78 tons of trash. Records show that the month of April had the highest amount of compactor trash hauled since County Waste became our service provider. A total of 46.90 tons of trash was removed. Typical month hauls range between 25 and 35 tons with higher amounts around Christmas. COMPACTOR PROJECT-RESUMED July 5th a meeting was held with an engineer who designed and built a Compactor area for the Pocono Woodlands Community. We reviewed design and function for the area. The engineer will propose two costs one for Design only and the other for Design and Build. After much thought and consideration it was best felt that this project be overseen by an engineer. SALVATION ARMY COLLECTION We held our first on site collection on May 5th. Ellen Long and her staff were set up in the bus parking lot and collected a box truck of donations. They were very impressed with the amount of donations collected and very appreciative. Due to the success of this collection we will hold another on Saturday, October 20th. VEHICLES In February our 2007 F550 suffered damage when a pulley broke and ended up behind a balancer. The truck required a front motor cover, turbo intake, hose and radiator hose. It was repaired and returned to service. 2008 F550 The 2008 F550 has been a drain on our vehicle maintenance budget and staff over the past two years. In March it suffered damage to a u-joint. Repairs were completed for that damage and the vehicle was put up for sale. After three months it was sold for 8500.00 and limped out of here forever. 2010 FREIGHTLINER- This vehicle lost its 4 wheel drive while plowing Christmas Eve night. Due to the holiday and with suppliers either closed or low staffed, there was a delay in obtaining parts for the repair. Due to demand for this truck in the winter, wheel chains were used until the coast was clear from snow. NEW VEHICLE PURCHASED A 2018 GMC Sierra was purchased and up-fitted with a dump body and plow. The vehicle was purchased from Schwarz GMC and up-fitted by Bonham Road Supplies and Equipment, both of Honesdale, PA. The vehicle has a Duramax 6.6L Turbo Diesel V8 and was picked up on April 20th. The cost of the new vehicle and equipment was 81,097.62. Funds from the CLCA General Reserve were used to make this purchase. PHONE SYSTEM Due to increasing costs and lack of features available for those costs, our phone system was changed from Verizon to Blue Ridge this past April. Software glitches with our tele-pad system required that line to be returned to Verizon. Members have inquired about using their cell phones for the tele pad. Unfortunately only home lines and cell phones with a local exchange continue to be the only lines that work with the tele pad. We have found that some members were able to switch their homeland line numbers to their cell phones and successfully eliminate their home lines and use their cell for the tele pad. If you currently have a land line and a cell phone, you may want to call your cellphone provider to see if the land line number can be switched out with your cell. There may be a one-time charge for this service and you will no longer have your cell number. GOVERNORS CABINET MEETINGS On Feb 1st a meeting called The Cabinet in the Community was held at Wallenpaupack HS. Four secretaries from Governor Wolf s cabinet were on hand to address questions. Representatives from the DEP, Department of Aging, Department of Agriculture and Department of Health were on hand. The seminar was informative. One item of particular interest that was discussed is the presence of an insect that is a threat to agriculture. There have been no reported sightings of this insect in Pike County, however there was one sighting in Monroe. Maintenance Foreman Dave also learned about these insects as they were a very hot topic of discussion during Arborist classes he attended in January.

The audit is very thorough and detailed. It begins in November and continues through late winter. A copy of the Financial report is available at the CLCA Office for review. ALL CLEAR! In May the septic tanks for the Rec Building and Office were pumped. No issues found. STORM WATER MANAGEMENT On May 15th Dave and I attended a Good Practices for Storm Water Management seminar. This was a free seminar facilitated by the Pike County Conservation Department and included visits to 4 facilities to observe good storm water control. Retention ponds, rain gardens and more sophisticated drainage and cistern systems were exhibited. Also included and very interesting were samplings of asphalt and concrete surfaces that are permeable allowing water to seep rather than run off to adjacent areas. It was a very interesting and worthwhile seminar. COLLECTIONS: In November 2017, twelve accounts were referred to Attorney Farleys office for collection. Five of the twelve referred accounts were paid by the owners before legal action commenced. The remaining seven accounts were referred to the Magistrate for Judgements to be filed. Judgements are then filed with the Prothonotarys office and remain on file for five years or until the judgment is paid. Judgments are renewable after the five year time period. JUDICIAL SALE. April 25th there were a total of 9 CLCA properties up for sale for non-payment of taxes. No bids were made on the properties during the live auction. On Saturday July 14, 2018 the Board of Directors voted unanimously to make the following change to the CLCA RulesFine associated with the use of fireworks within the community. First Offense - 500.00 Second Offense - 1000.00 A discussion included what constitutes fireworks. Fireworks include PROJECTILES ie roman candles, bottle rockets, mortars and EXPLOSIVE fireworks such as fire crackers, M-80s, cherry bombs etc. Fireworks do not include sparklers, snakes, poppers, small novelty varieties. Basically if it flies in the air andor explodes it is not permitted. Filing a Complaint: While it is not our goal to have members battling members over violations, some are pushed beyond their patience and need an outlet to have a violation addressed. Enforcement can also be accomplished when a formal, written complaint is filed with the office. If you wish to file a formal complaint it must be done in writing with the office by completing a complaint form or sending an email. Complainants need to contain specific facts including date, time and location as in address, of the violation. Complaints must be signed in hand or electronically. Anonymous complaints will not be accepted. Valid complaints will result in a citation being issued to the violators. In the event that the violator contests the citation whether it resulted from Security citation or from a formal complaint they are entitled to a hearing. Due process is owed to anyone issued a violation. In the event that the citation is contested, the complainant should be prepared to provide testimony for a hearing. It is important to know that the burden of proof that a violation has occurred is on the CommunitySecurity andor the Complainant. Any additional evidence supplied such as video, dash cam footage etc. will be beneficial in helping the Hearing Committee determine if the violation holds. Special Note Regarding Social Media: While posting on Facebook or other social media may provide individuals a place to vent or discuss concerns with other members it does not constitute a formal complaint. Response to Facebook posts may occur but should not be expected. MAINTENANCE SHOP FOUNDATION WALL Sometime in May it was noticed that the basement wall in the Maintenance shop was starting to bow. Two contractors were called in to provide bids on the repair. One contractor did not show up for two appointments. Cutting Edge Mason began repairs to the foundation of the building on June 14 and the job completed June 20th. The repair cost was 7480.98 plus an additional 250.00 for clean fill from DS Stone. We were fortunate that the existing footings did not have to be replaced which would have cost an additional 4300.00. Payment for these repairs were made from the General Reserve Account. ROAD PAVING 2018 During the month of June Dave met with Wayco representatives and reviewed roads that need to be repaired and roads to be paved. The Board approved and announced the following repairs and new paving during their July Meeting: IROQUOIS TRAIL FROM ONEIDA TO CONKLIN- REPAIR Roadway is badly worn and in need of repaving. Maintenance removed 4 aging culvert pipes from under Iroquois. 3 of the pipes have been replaced. The fourth was not a functional pipe. CONKLIN DRIVE- REPAIR Continuation of the above repairs. Currently unpaved and to be newly paved roads are: Braxton Way, Heyward Lane and Hart Court. Cost for the above work will be 160,165.00. The funds for this work will be paid from the Road Reserve Account and road repair budget. For information regarding the pool and rec building projects, please see separate articles.

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20182019 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 29th. The meeting will be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Refreshments will be served. All members will receive a ballot to vote. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted. CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding candidates and the budget. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail- in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office. Hello and Welcome! Conashaugh welcomes the Finegans.

She has been a member of the Communications Committee since 2016 and has contributed a number of upbeat, fun articles to The Courier. Valerie moved here 10 years ago to escape the taxation of NJ, and to live with her now husband. Valerie was the regional sales manager for a major retail broker company until six years ago. She was also one of the original Leggs pantyhose representatives. She has been retired for 2 years. She enjoys traveling with her husband on his work assignments from Washington DC, to the shores of Lake Erie. She has 5 children between her and her husband. Valerie is the type of person that after you meet her, you will always remember her. She brings a vibrant personality and fresh ideas to our Board and Community. Valerie Ferlauto CONASHAUGH LETTERS This community has meant a lot to me over the last 22 years. It has been a safe haven for my children to grow up in over the many fond years. My wish was during my time on the Board was to try to do the same for the future families as the boards before me did for mine. I will miss the small town feeling it has given me throughout the years. I truly hope that some new members rise up to the challenge that is before them. Our board is aging and needs the younger families to step up and take ownership. To my fellow board members....it has been a pleasure to serve with you. Thank you for your service, volunteerism and most of all your friendship. Thank you again for all of the great years and memories. You will all be missed but never forgotten. Respectfully yours, Michael P. Stevenson Picnic was great! Food and weather....perfect! Everyone did a great job putting it together. Thank you. Barbara  Bobby Next DUMPSTER DAY Saturday October 20 th 8 a.m. till 3 p.m. Hi, my name is Annette Musano. My family and I have been CLCA members since 2005. Last year at the annual meeting I was appointed to fill in the vacant slot as Rec Liaison and this year I am running for that position. Several years after moving into the community, I became active in helping out at Rec events on a regular basis. I later joined the Environmental Committee and functioned as their secretary for 3 years. Then in 2016 I became the assistant chair of the Rec Committee and we successfully resurrected and revamped some of the wonderful events done in the past with enthusiastic turnouts for the most part. The next year I acted as the chair and again we ran several successful events. I also have been part of the annual picnic committee for the past 10 years as I see the event as a fantastic way for neighbors to get together on a social basis and meet new CLCA members. A pet peeve of mine is keeping this community as pristine as nature intended it with total respect for our environment. I have written articles for the Courier regarding this and I m sure youve seen my son and I regularly picking up trash on the side of our roads. I would like to see a formal committee formed for that purpose. My husband and I chose Conashaugh over the other communities in the area based on its beauty, amenities, advice of realtors, the reputation of its members and those employees involved in the day to day operations of the community. We should be proud and grateful to live here and I would like to see that pride and sense of gratitude, care and concern for our members continue for years to come. I truly feel that the best way to be part of our wonderful community is to get involved and share your time and talents and I encourage all CLCA members to do so. Annette Musano Bill King I grew up on the tide waters of the Chesapeake Bay in southern Maryland, fishing, crabbing, hunting and farming. As a teenager I spent summers working on a tobacco farm during the day while catching and selling crabs early in the morning. Worked my way through college back in the days when you could do that, as an auto parts clerk, graduating from the University of Maryland. Ive been married 37 years to my wonderful, lovely, and patient have to be with me wife, Karen. We have two sons who have long since flown the nest and one grandson. We attend Milford Bible Church. Shortly after college I joined Motorola where I spent the next 27 years, primarily in their first responder communication sector. Leaving Motorola in 2006 I subsequently worked for two other companies based out of New Y ork City, Brookwood Companies Incorporated and The New Y ork City Leadership Center, Inc. Employment has kept my wife, Karen, and I moving around. Beginning with my home state of Maryland and her home state of Pennsylvania, we have also lived in the Chicago suburbs, Dallas area, south Florida, northern New Jersey, and New Y ork City. We hope to settle here in Conashaugh Lakes! In 2014, I semi-retired and we moved full time to Conashaugh Lakes. But in 2016 I was enticed back to work part-time for Brookwood Companies Incorporated a textile firm that specializes in military applications. My second time around with the company and a very long story. Karen and I love the wild life and serenity of the community. And have appreciated and found the majority of the residents to be good folks who really care about family, neighbors, community, and country. My biggest lesson learned over the years is to treat all people fairly, transparently, and truthfully. I may not agree with you, but I will listen to and respect your opinion.",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 10 Bears Gone Wild CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 BY: JEANNE CALABRESE The late arrival of spring to our area did not delay their waking up and foraging for food. Members posted photos on Facebook of our furry neighbors as they lumbered through yards and in some cases got a little too close for comfort. Bird feeders went missing, sheds were broken into and even car doors were opened by these clever tricksters. Bears in the compactor area, the tennis courts at the beach. For the first time in more than ten years they even ventured into the pool area resulting in short closure periods to allow them to be safely redirected. We received calls regarding bears along with calls for us to remove the bears. We live in an area populated with bears. We do not remove bears. We do encourage everyone to follow good practices to not attract bears to their properties. If a bear becomes a nuisance the Game Commission can be contacted. Their phone number is 570-675-1143 or 570-675-1144. If you call the Game Commission be ready to answer questions regarding what you are doing to prevent attracting bears to your property. Bears in your trees, walking through your yard or down a road are not considered nuisance bears. Tearing down bird feeders, eating garbage left outside in shedscarstruck beds or garages is not the bears fault. Theyre bears. They are clever opportunists. Dont give them opportunities and never feed them. You may or may not have heard the saying a fed bear is a dead bear. Think about that statement and realize the consequences that may occur if you are feeding bears. Bears by nature are fearful of humans. However, if you invite them to dine at your property, guess what, they keep coming back and then become a nuisance and possibly dangerous to not only you but other people. Feeding bears also subjects you to a hefty fine from the Pennsylvania Game Warden. Please dont do it. The following link is to the Pennsylvania Game Commission regarding living with these creatures. http:www.pgc.pa.govBlaPages LivingwithBlackBears.aspx Friendly Reminder If you are planning to pave your driveway, please contact the office for a no cost inspection by maintenance. This inspection is to determine if you need to install or replace a culvert pipe. Please do this in advance of arranging a date for paving. Thank you. This year we said good bye to some wonderful folks who moved on to new adventures. Mike Stevenson and John and Lynn McCauley all served on the CLCA Board of Directors during various times over many years. Mike sold his home and a second property this year and John and Lynn are enjoying well deserved retirement in North Carolina. Thank you all for your service at Conashaugh Lakes! Farewell and Thank You!",

A warmer and longer than usual fall allowed for construction to continue into November. However, winter extended her stay which resulted in a lot of nail biting and wondering if everything would be completed in time for opening day. For the past several years the pool deck had to be continuously jack hammered open to access and repair plumbing lines. It seemed that no sooner would a line be repaired, another one would break. All of this breakage resulted in a lot of water loss and having to top off the pool, as much as four inches per day plus a lot of maintenance repairs. An outside contractor was called in at one point to use leak seeking cameras to determine where leaks were happening. It was time to stop chasing these leaks and replace the original, forty plus year old plumbing. The estimated cost for the project was 83,000.00. Payments for the project were made from reserve money saved for the purpose of repairing, replacing and preserving our assets. The repair to the pool included removal and replacement of all the concrete decking surrounding the pool and plumbing for the filtration system. New features included a propane heater and new underwater LED lighting for the main pool and a water fountain feature for the baby pool. The main construction work was completed by Pro-Pools of Green Lane, Pa., the same company that installed the Delifol liner, tile work and new coping a few years ago. The heater was also purchased from Pro-Pools. Installation of the heater and the propane tanks needed to operate was completed by Bottini Fuels. All of the electrical work was performed by Leonard Boyle of Milford. It wouldnt be a project without a few hidden surprises. Len Boyle discovered some rodents made the pool service panel their home and dined on protective covering on wiring. Our last minute heroes were the volunteers from the Dingman Township Fire Department who with the assistance of a pumper truck, filled the pool with water from Seneca Lake. Their services saved the community a bundle of money. The one hundred thousand gallons needed to fill the pool would have taxed our well and the cost to buy water, well, that was just plain cost prohibitive. Maintenance did their magic and shocked and vacuumed the pool and while the heater was not ready for operation by opening day, an abundance of sunshine allowed water temperatures to reach to the mid-seventies. The pool opened as scheduled on the last day of school and we had an impressive turn out. Feedback from residents regarding the renovations and added features has been positive. The heater install was subsequently completed and thermostat for the pool heater has been set at a comfortable eighty degrees. Tanks supplying propane to the pool are independent from building heat tanks and the usage and costs are being monitored for future budgeting. The cost to date for this project is 75,208.00. We hope that many of the members here have taken some time to enjoy the pool this year. CONASHAUGH NEWS",

Dumpster day volunteers worked alongside maintenance employees removing trash items from members vehicles. Meanwhile a Salvation Army Truck and volunteers were parked at the bus lot collecting all kinds of treasures. As this was all happening a bunch of volunteers worked picking up trash along our roads. A total of 14.78 tons of trash items were collected in three, thirty yard dumpsters in the maintenance yard. Time is precious and valuable. Thank you to all of our volunteers for donating theirs to minimize costs for these services. It is very much appreciated. Our next Dumpster Day will be held on Saturday, October 20th.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 14 BY VALERIE FERLAUTO Do you ever wonder how things get done around Conashaugh Lakes? I know some of you think that little elves come out at night and set up tents, tables and chairs. That wonderful foods materialize on said tables by magic. The reality is that events that happen here at Conashaugh Lakes are due to hours of preparation by volunteers, who begin months before any event takes place. Conashaugh Lakes Annual Community Picnic is one of those events. Here are some of the statistics that are used to measure some of the prior proper planning that goes into the event:  We are a community of seven hundred plus owners  392 people RSVPd for this years picnic  278 people actually showed up for the event  Approximately twenty-two people dedicated their time, energy, creativity and talents to planning and executing the Annual Picnic What do these statistics mean? Well for one, twenty-two of our fellow community members did the work for all 278 people in attendance. A big thank you to all of you who took the time away from your normal lives to dedicate yourselves to the rest of us. Y ou did an amazing job! I asked Patti Havecost why? Why volunteer to make this day happen? She told me that she has lived here for twenty nine years and she loves the sense of community that she gets from living here, especially at the Annual Picnic. Her thirty years working in the restaurant and catering industries were on point. If you were at the picnic and arent sure who Patti is, let me tell you, she was the tall blond managing the buffet area, with grace and expertise, a smile on her face and when she laughed, you knew she meant it because she has a sincere contagious laugh. She made sure that there was always plenty of HOT, yummy food available for our members. She told me that she loved standing there chit chatting with everyone as she constantly kept the buffet stocked and clean. The Annual Picnic Committee begins their planning several months before the picnic. Their meetings are open to everyone in our community. The core planners and shoppers for this years picnic were Annette Musano, Cindy Gomez, Ron and Elaine McDermott, Judy Weed, Patti Havekost, Jeanne Calabrese, Larry Farnum, Jean Forichon, Sally Yearwood and Ingrid Fox. The planning meetings were short and sweet which makes me wonder if they served any chocolate at these meetings? Everyone ran with their assigned tasks which included reserving tents, ordering food, hiring a DJ, advertising, co-ordinating with Maintenance, inventorying supplies on hand and buying what was needed. After the months of planning it is the week leading into the picnic that our volunteers put plans into action. Elaine and Ron McDermott graciously allow us to store, among other things, the beverages and coolers used at the picnic. They also provide all that HOT water that is used in the chaffing dishes to keep the food, well, hot. We are fortunate that they willingly open their garage to our community as it makes for a very easy move the day of the picnic. Jeanne, among the many other things she did for us, took the time to organize big plastic bins filled with pot holders, rubber gloves used in food prep, utensils, metal pans, chaffing dishes etc. When the picnic was over, she also took all of these things to her home and deep cleaned and washed everything so they are ready for our next event. Thank you to our Maintenance Men! A few days before the picnic they begin the process of preparing chairs, tables, BBQ and tents. A nice Power Wash, loading onto trucks and transporting to the lake, as well as breaking down at the end of the picnic and putting all nice and neatly away until our next event. At the time some of us were just sipping our first cup of coffee volunteers began to arrive at the scene. Some of our volunteers were already at the lake making sure everything was CLCA Annual Picnic Continued on Page 19",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2018 PAGE 16 CONASHAUGH NEWS Heres a little history of the building that we anyone involved in the current renovations have come to know as the Wreck Building. While the exact age of the building is not readily available, an appraisal performed on it in 1991 estimated it to be twenty- one years old at that time. It was originally the sales office for CLCA. People would come and oooh and ahh at the lovely pool buy their land and get a free toaster. Im not sure prospective buyers were given a toaster but it was some kind of incentivethank you. Anyway, the structure was surrounded by a deck on three sides. Eventually with the growth of Conashaugh and the need for office space it was decided to enclose the rear deck facing the pool and side deck along Oneida way. From what information that can be gathered, this task was done lovingly by volunteers in the Community. Eventually CLCA purchased the property where the current office is located and the original office became the Rec Building. From archive photos it served the Community well for meetings, parties and even a snack stand and haunted house one Halloween. Fast forward to late summer 2016. Estimates were sought to install vinyl siding and some new rear windows for the building. Those estimates were for 31,050.00, 27,890.00 Rec Building and 20,187.00. The time was not right for that work so those estimates were put on the back burner to be revisited the following year. In the meantime the deck at the office was in dire need to be repaired and became the priority. That work was completed by Frank Gorman of FSG Siding and Decking, the contractor who is working at the Rec Building and coincidentally the contractor who provided the lowest bid for the Rec Building job. It should be noted that it wasnt only the number on the bid that got FSG the job but the beautiful and meticulous work on the deck for the office, also at a very good price. By early summer 2017 Frank began consulting on behalf of Conashaugh with Dingman Township regarding the proposed project and it was learned that we needed to include a handicap ramp for the entry. Easy peasy. Frank prepared a supplemental estimate for the ramp and submitted paperwork for the permit. On September 28th we received a letter denying our permit because the proposed ramp was less than 40 feet from the road. Considering the building is less than 40 feet from the road it was obvious that we go back to the drawing board to come up with a revised plan or pay an attorney and additional fees for a variance hearing. Frank came back with an alternative plan for the ramp and it was approved by the CLCA Board in October. The revised plans and permit for the project were approved by the Township November 6th. It should be noted that the contractor at this point had put in a lot of time on this project and had not received a dime. Meanwhile, thanks to stretch of better than anticipated weather our pool contractors were still working in the pool yard which was good for their project but further delayed the start of the Rec Building work. Once the pool contractors packed up their wares the Rec Building project began in mid-December with the removal and replacement of the back windows. January and February was when the real fun began. When the windows were removed it was discovered the walls werent insulated. Electrical outlets had to be moved, call the electrician. Easy! More windows were removed and guess what? Missing headers, improper framing and oh, mice ate the wiring. At this point it was decided to secure an estimate for new insulation and sheetrock for the ceiling and walls. The Board also approved to install a new HVAC unit. SOS Heating to the rescue. Time to get another permit! In between the demolition and installations, life went on in Conashaugh with Committee, Board and Scout meetings. Frank without complaint moved all of his tools and materials from one side of the building to the other to accommodate making space for these meetings. He even set up tables and he never complained when said meetings were cancelled. Exterior work began with the removal and replacement of the front steps which required footings. The existing steps were set on rocks, blobs of cement and even on dirt. Sheetrock removed by the front door revealed more electrical nightmares. Call back the electrician! Back to the sheetrock. Who knew the building is four inches lower on one side than the other? Time to get the jack and replace corner supports that were improperly installed on the Oneida side of the building. That post holding up the left side roof? It was rotted from the ground down to the non-existing footing which also allowed the left side deck to rise and fall with the temperatures over the years and pull the foundation. All of the aforementioned has been addressed. Then there was March. No need to repeat that nightmare but the reader should know that while we were lucky to have only five days without power, our contractor was one of the luckier ones to go without for eleven days. Spring and warm weather finally arrived sometime in May and then the pool guys had to come back into the yard with all of their equipment to finish pouring concrete. Exterior siding resumed. Ceiling and wall painting was not part of the estimates and completed by a volunteer on their week off from work. A new handicap accessible bathroom was added to the mix. Yes, its taken some time to complete renovations at the Rec Building. There are many who are looking forward to its completion. Frank may not be the fastest contractor but he is honest, reliable, helpful and accommodating. Although he occasionally has help he mostly works solo. At this point hes gone beyond working to correct the problems hes encountered. He didnt walk away. Someone else may have run in the other direction or go home one day and not come back or worse yet, covered the sins and say sayonara. There are plenty of pictures of all that is described. If you have doubt, feel free to request to see them. This project started at 20,187.00 for windows, siding and a deck. The additional work handicap ramp, extended rear deck, hc accessible bathroom, new insulation and sheetrock interior results in a revised estimate of approximately 39,000.00. This amount does not include electrical, HVAC, painting and finish flooring and cabinetry which are not included in the estimates and have or will be completed by others.We all look forward to its completion.",

Have you heard of the spotted lanternfly? This pests potential to severely impact the agricultural and hardwood industries in Pennsylvania was discussed recently during a number of locally held Cabinet in your Community sessions. While there have been no reported sightings in this immediate area, thirteen Pennsylvania Counties are under quarantine for this insect. The closest county, Monroe, is right next door. As part of the quarantine the public is asked to look for and dispose of egg masses, check vehicles and campers for egg masses and insects before leaving a quarantined area. The public is also asked not to transport brush, yard or construction waste or firewood outside of quarantined areas.

CLCA Fishing Day OUTDOOR  RECREATION in place for us. Besides our Maintenance men, Larry Farnum, Neil Johnson, Ed Calabrese and Ed Kelly were all there making sure everything was in its place. Around eleven the Prime Time Convoy headed out to get the food! We had thirty five trays of hot food and eight huge boxes of hamburgers! YIKES! Thank you Patti Havekost, David Weed, Ron McDermott and Cindy Gomez. Annette Musano was our salad shopper, chopper and all day Samaritan. As well as one of the greeters at our welcome table. David and Judy Weed, Kim Decker, Ingrid Fox, Christina Villanueva and Cindy Gomez were at the scene setting up tables, laying down table clothes and lending help to make this day possible for all of us. Jasmine Drury put a smile on a lot of childrens faces with the Egg Hunt. Pete Denigris was on constant garbage duty as well as chief cheese placement for burgers. Kim Decker was a greeter at our welcome table. Six hours into our volunteers day, the Conashaugh Lakes Annual Community Picnic started! DJ played music, food was eaten and enjoyed, people danced, eggs were hunted and games were played! Five oclock arrived and our volunteers were still working, cleaning up and putting things away. They were lucky as a few members helped fold up tables, chairs and table clothes. Patti and Jeanne packed up the leftovers and the bins of supplies and brought them all back to the Rec Center. With the help of some of our pool staff, Nick Christianson and Vincent Hussey food has been properly frozen for use at the volunteer picnic. During the day many volunteers could be heard saying NEVER again! By seven oclock these same volunteers were laying plans for next years picnic, taking notes on what went well that they want to repeat and what they may leave out. My suggestion to you, thank our volunteers! Let them know you had a good time at our picnic. Volunteer yourself for our next event. All are welcome! My apologies to any volunteer I left out.

Have you noticed the changes at our gates? Every time I drive through the gates and I see the incredible artistry that has been created for us to enjoy, it puts a smile on my face. How can a few buckets filled with dirt and flowers, sprigs of trees and twigs be put together in such a wonderful style? I have been wondering who it was, and who has shared their talents with us. Well, my neighbors of Conashaugh Lakes, we are truly the lucky ones! Two gentlemen have stepped forward and offered their expertise to create these buckets of beauty for all of us to enjoy. The creative team of David Westerfer and Corey Nealon are our neighbors here at Conashaugh Lakes. Even though their home is their home away from home, it is the place they really want to be all of the time. Three years ago they fell in love with our community and bought a lake front home. They have redesigned it with their own personal touch. I recently took a tour of their home and realized that their creativity is expressed with style and grace. Every detail of their home is an expression of their artistry and love of nature. They have decorated their home with a medley of woods that are amazing to the eye. A chandelier that Davids mother made for the Greenhouse room, mirrors trimmed in wood, a table and bench chairs made out of a tree in their dining area. David made a wonderful double Queen Size platform bed out of a light pine tree. This bed also serves as storage space for their Christmas decorations. Bringing nature and practicality together in an aesthetically pleasing way. At a young age David knew he loved nature, architectural landscaping, and plant life. Growing up in Philadelphia, he had the opportunity to attend W.B. Saul High School of Agricultural Sciences in Roxborough, Pennsylvania.

Important Information, Please Read Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are imminent. Although we made it through the first half of January with no significant snow, weve experienced temperatures way below normal and our roads are frozen. Whats frozen will thaw and when the thaw occurs a road ban will occur. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVWgross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes. Please feel free to call the office if you do not have access to the internet. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they didnt know. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation. Need to Pay Dues? We accept Discover, Mastercard  Visa Debit and Credit Cards. You can also schedule auto pays through your checking account! CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2018 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Snow Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicles at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible to for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Power Outages During a power outage all of the entry and exit gates go into the up position. The gates have back up batteries that allow for this to happen instead of staying in the down position. Gates cannot be manually lifted or operated without power. Once power is restored the gates will go to the down position. The compactors cannot operate without power therefore they will be closed. Please hold trash until the power is restored and the compactors can be reopened. Do not leave trash outside the gate or throw it in the recycle bins. The office is now equipped with an electric panel to accommodate a portable generator. While the generator is not able to provide power to the electric heat in the building, it will enable for basic power to provide water and septic and allow for use of limited space heaters and lights. CLCA Board of Director Meetings The Board of Directors meet every second Saturday of each month. The meetings start at 10:30 a.m. and are held in the Rec Building. All are welcome! Meetings for the remainder of the CLCA 2018 fiscal year are as follows: February 10 March 10 April 14 May 12 June 9 July 14 August 11 September 8 The 2018 Annual Meeting will be held Saturday, September 29 th.

As announced in the last issue of the Courier we changed carriers for our trash services. County Waste became our carrier effective July 1, 2017. County Waste has been a provider of trash services in this area for a number of years and we are happy to report that they are doing a fine job here at Conashaugh. County Waste picks up both our regular, household trash and recyclables. In an effort to keep the trash moving we have a maintenance worker Pete who mans the compactor on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. He has also worked holidays when maintenance is closed. Pete is there to monitor incoming trash and keep the compactor operating. The compactor is currently open 7 days per week. Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m. These schedules are subject to change due to weather or holidays. What to do if you find the compactor full  Do not leave your trash on the ground. We are not here to clean up your mess.  Do not remove someone elses trash to make room for yours.  Do not jam your trash in and then slam the door so that the next person gets a trash shower when they open the door. Have a heart and call for someone to run the compactor. Who to Call:  If during business hours 8 till 4 Monday through Friday call the office  If after business hours call the Com Center for Security 1-800-916-7501  If you suspect a person from outside the Community is using the compactor, please provide us with the time, date and if possible vehicle information. It is important that this information is given to the office as soon as possible to preserve evidence. All information will be used to review cameras, gate card Trash Talk usage and tele pad calls to homes and the com center to determine the violators. All information will be kept confident. If you are lending your card, entry code or letting someone in for the purpose of using our compactors you are subject to major fines and permanent deactivation of the gate cards used. The person you allow to do this is subject to prosecution for theft of services. Trash Tips: The compactor fills quickly between 3:00 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. weekdays. If you dont like the inconvenience of finding the compactor full, definitely avoid bringing your trash between those hours. Make regular trips to the compactor to avoid hoarding piles of bags and then jamming up the compactor with your deposit. There is some irony to arriving to the compactor and finding a person there complaining that there is no room while they are standing there with their own small landfill of black bags. If you must bring multiple bags of trash, do so on Saturdays or Sundays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. At least there is someone there to compact it giving the members who dont stockpile trash a chance. We have increased from three to four recycling containers. The bins are emptied on Tuesdays and Thursdays each week. We do not recycle electronics except on Dumpster Day. Members have access to recycling 247. There are cut outs at the back for the purpose of depositing recyclables. Unfortunately some members have used these bins as their personal dumpsters. Items such as televisions and other electronics are not to be placed in the bins. We have had to lock down the bins a couple of times because of illegal dumping. If you are found doing this, you will be fined heftily. Please flatten all boxes and be sure to remove Styrofoam forms from packages. Plastic bags except those containing shredded paper are not to be thrown in the recycle bin. If you bring your recyclables in a plastic bag, please either deposit it in the provided bag receptacle or bring it home. Dumpster day is held two times per year, once in the fall and once in the spring. Watch for details regarding the 2018 spring date. We are always looking for volunteers to help. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2018 PAGE 5 Due to an observable resurgence of trash along our Community roads the following article from 2014 deserves a re-run. The above photos of trash collected by maintenance personnel are from this past November. Trash Revisited Several years ago I wrote an article for the Courier entitled Trash Begets Trash. In its contents I cited the duration of time it takes for various trash items to decomposebiodegrade. At this time I have no intentions of repeating any of that information other than to remind my readers that aluminum foil, plastic bottles and Styrofoam cups are not biodegradable. It is quite obvious to me that many of the litter offenders out there either didnt read my article or just dont give a darn as this continues to be a significant problem along the various roads and common areas of Conashaugh. I want to say that despite the fact that my son and I are growing somewhat weary, the constant new supply of trash will not deter us from our mission of trying to keep the roads litter free. It does, however, continue to boggle my mind that the littering somehow defiles the laws of physics in this community. How else can you explain the mere fact that a person can walk along the road carrying a container full of liquid but once the product is consumed, the empty and obviously lighter weight receptacle can no longer be held on to and must but tossed on the road as if it is too heavy to carry. As I see it, it all comes down to one simple word - RESPECT; respect for the earth, respect for the environment, respect for your community, respect for your friends and neighbors, respect for yourself. In the immortal words of Forrest Gump, Thats all I have to say about that. Annette Musano Please pick up after your dog. No, its not a rule. Its the right thing to do. Thank you. CLC ASSOCIATION CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2018 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION created a learning experience that he now shares with us. The courses he took included Plant Life, Landscape Design, Floral Culture, and Architectural Design. We have the evidence of what he has learned in high school at our gates. After high school he went to Westchester University and majored in Education, followed by a four year teaching position. As much as he loved teaching, he thought he would enjoy a more lucrative career in sales. His career, in medical device sales, took him away from Pennsylvania to the Big Apple where he lives now, most of the time. Lucky for us, this is where he met Corey. Corey came to New York City by way of The Green Mountain State of Vermont. That is a lot of nature to leave behind for city life. The purpose of leaving the natural beauty of Bennington was to attend Manhattan College to study Broadcast Journalism. He was an intern and later began his career at MTV. While at MTV he was involved in producing, branding and marketing. Shows such as Mob Wives. WOW! He has since moved on to a different side of the media world working in advertising, heading up social media content. When I tell you they fell in love with Conashaugh Lakes, I mean it, they give our community all theyve got and more. In their down time they are often found roaming the streets of our community looking for the orphans of Conashaugh Trail. By orphans, I mean, the unwanted things that our fellow neighbors throw out the windows of their cars! Just think, if we all took better care of our unwanted things and disposed of them properly, David and Corey would have more time on their hands to put to use other ideas they have for keeping our community naturally beautiful and welcoming. This Dynamic Duo would love to donate their time and expertise to creating a Beautify Conashaugh Lakes Club. They have some fantastic ideas that would require some sweat equity from a few of our neighbors that we would all benefit from. If you have the time, the interest or the desire to join The Dynamic Duo in their pursuit, call me and we can get started immediately! Phone: 570-409-6184. If not, then my suggestion is, the next time you see them collecting those orphans along the side of the road, stop and thank them, they deserve it! Fellow Conashaugh Lakers, We Have Artesian Planter Architects Amongst Us! Continued from Page 1 Thank you to the Community volunteers who helped the CLCA Maintenance staff with our fall Dumpster Day event. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2018 PAGE 7 CLC ASSOCIATION Conashaugh Has Another Author in Its Midst Ive been a resident of Conashaugh Lakes since 1996. Both my wife and I retired in 2009. Our sons Michael and Christian both went to DVHS and graduated. They went on to attend Drexel University and Penn State. We are very proud of our sons. This past year my son Christian published his novel Human Again after four years of hard work. His book is available on Amazon.com Nook and kindle. And for those who support our local library you can find a hard copy in the Milford and Log Tavern Road branches. Its a well written novel of romance, action and horror. Thank you for reading this article and supporting our son. Albert Santos Editors Note: Here are some reviews from Amazon: Fantastic Read. If I had to compare to existing horror writers, I would say that Stephen King and Clive Barker had a child. I could give a more formal critique but currently I am still running too high on the endorphins pumping through my system having just finished the book. I started reading yesterday. This morning with coffee I thought that I would read some more, having had things to do today. In case you havent figured it out, I did not get to those things. You like horror? Then why are you wasting time reading this review? I dont write horror. This guy does and very well. FAQ- Do I Need a Permit? Spring is a great time for home improvement projects both indoors and out. Below is a partial list of more common projects done by homeowners and require permits from the CLCA Office:  Roof Replacement  Painting exterior of home color approval  Swimming Pools, spas  hot tubs  Fences  Decks  Fire pits  Tree  Brush removal  Major Landscaping projects or to change property grade For tree and brush removal permits simply mark trees and areas with ribbon. Please do not spray paint or use other means of permanent marking. Contact the office and request an inspection. The inspection will be conducted within 10 ten business days. Please display tree permits at the entrance of your property in a conspicuous location. Remind contractors to not block roadways and to use proper signage andor traffic alert equipment while working at your property. Please note and plan accordingly for projects that may need to be reviewed and approved by the CLCA Design Review Committee. This Committee meets the third Saturday of each month. Additional permits may be required from Dingman Township. For Township information visit their website at http:www. dingmantownship.org.

Dear Parents  Guardians of Student Walkers This year we have experienced an increase of students walking to and from the CLCA bus lot. Along with that, is an increase of concern for their safety. We have been notified of groups of students walking down the middle of the road or not yielding far enough to the side of the road to allow vehicles to safely pass. The fol- lowing information is from PennDOTs website relating to pedestrian safety:  In the absence of sidewalk and shoulder, pedestrian may walk in road, as close to the edge as practicable and must walk on left side of road facing traffic. Please take a moment and review pe - destrian safety with your child. It is important and applies to everyone.

Following the end of the 2017 season work began to replace plumbing for the pools filtration systems. In addition to those repairs the Board of Directors approved installation of a heating system for the pool that will hopefully allow for more enjoyable experiences for members. The work for the plumbing repairs required removal of the pool deck to access and replace the piping. A new concrete deck will be installed. Due to some extended nice weather a good portion of the pool deck was already poured. The baby pool will also include a water feature. The pool work is being done by Woods Pools. They are the same company that installed the beautiful pool liner a few years back. The work is not yet completed and Woods will be back in the spring. Lets hope for an early one this year! The Rec Building is also in the midst of a much needed facelift. The rear floor to ceiling windows have been removed and replaced with double hung windows. New vinyl siding and trim will be installed along with gutters and downspouts. There will be a new, extended deck on the back as well as a wheel chair ramp along the east side of the building. The construction at the Rec Building is being done by Frank Gorman of FSG Decking and Siding. We were very happy with the beautiful job Frank did with updating the deck at the office and cant wait to see the finished Rec Building project! OUTDOOR  RECREATION Annual Flea Market Scheduled!

THE FISH WEIGHED APPROXIMATELY TEN POUNDS AND JUST MIGHT MAKE HIM THE ENVY OF LOCAL ANGLERS! Thank You, Thank You, Thank You! Thanks to a very generous donation of professional costumes from resident Roberta Niesz, Conashaughs kids had a very special surprise waiting for them when they returned from their first day of school. It was hard to tell who was more excited that day, the children or the waiting characters. An appearance was made by none other than Mickey Mouse and the love of his life Minnie, Elmo and Raphael from Teenage Ninja Turtles. Additional donated costumes included Santa and Mrs. Claus and a Fairy Godmother outfit. Roberta, thanks to you there were and will continue to be a lot of happy faces and memories!

Have you noticed the changes at our gates? Every time I drive through the gates and I see the incredible artistry that has been created for us to enjoy, it puts a smile on my face. How can a few buckets filled with dirt and flowers, sprigs of trees and twigs be put together in such a wonderful style? I have been wondering who it was, and who has shared their talents with us. Well, my neighbors of Conashaugh Lakes, we are truly the lucky ones! Two gentlemen have stepped forward and offered their expertise to create these buckets of beauty for all of us to enjoy. The creative team of David Westerfer and Corey Nealon are our neighbors here at Conashaugh Lakes. Even though their home is their home away from home, it is the place they really want to be all of the time. Three years ago they fell in love with our community and bought a lake front home. They have redesigned it with their own personal touch. I recently took a tour of their home and realized that their creativity is expressed with style and grace. Every detail of their home is an expression of their artistry and love of nature. They have decorated their home with a medley of woods that are amazing to the eye. A chandelier that Davids mother made for the Greenhouse room, mirrors trimmed in wood, a table and bench chairs made out of a tree in their dining area. David made a wonderful double Queen Size platform bed out of a light pine tree. This bed also serves as storage space for their Christmas decorations. Bringing nature and practicality together in an aesthetically pleasing way. At a young age David knew he loved nature, architectural landscaping, and plant life. Growing up in Philadelphia, he had the opportunity to attend W.B. Saul High School of Agricultural Sciences in Roxborough, Pennsylvania. This school Continued on Page 6",

Important Information, Please Read Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are imminent. Although we made it through the first half of January with no significant snow, weve experienced temperatures way below normal and our roads are frozen. Whats frozen will thaw and when the thaw occurs a road ban will occur. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, others may not be so familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVWgross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP and on our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes. Please feel free to call the office if you do not have access to the internet. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they didnt know. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation. Need to Pay Dues? We accept Discover, Mastercard  Visa Debit and Credit Cards. You can also schedule auto pays through your checking account!",

This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicles at a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible to for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Power Outages During a power outage all of the entry and exit gates go into the up position. The gates have back up batteries that allow for this to happen instead of staying in the down position. Gates cannot be manually lifted or operated without power. Once power is restored the gates will go to the down position. The compactors cannot operate without power therefore they will be closed. Please hold trash until the power is restored and the compactors can be reopened. Do not leave trash outside the gate or throw it in the recycle bins. The office is now equipped with an electric panel to accommodate a portable generator. While the generator is not able to provide power to the electric heat in the building, it will enable for basic power to provide water and septic and allow for use of limited space heaters and lights. CLCA Board of Director Meetings The Board of Directors meet every second Saturday of each month. The meetings start at 10:30 a.m. and are held in the Rec Building. All are welcome!

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2018 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION Thank you to our members who observe trash rules and etiquette. As announced in the last issue of the Courier we changed carriers for our trash services. County Waste became our carrier effective July 1, 2017. County Waste has been a provider of trash services in this area for a number of years and we are happy to report that they are doing a fine job here at Conashaugh. County Waste picks up both our regular, household trash and recyclables. In an effort to keep the trash moving we have a maintenance worker Pete who mans the compactor on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. He has also worked holidays when maintenance is closed. Pete is there to monitor incoming trash and keep the compactor operating. The compactor is currently open 7 days per week. Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m. These schedules are subject to change due to weather or holidays. What to do if you find the compactor full  Do not leave your trash on the ground. We are not here to clean up your mess.  Do not remove someone elses trash to make room for yours.  Do not jam your trash in and then slam the door so that the next person gets a trash shower when they open the door. Have a heart and call for someone to run the compactor. Who to Call:  If during business hours 8 till 4 Monday through Friday call the office  If after business hours call the Com Center for Security 1-800-916-7501  If you suspect a person from outside the Community is using the compactor, please provide us with the time, date and if possible vehicle information. It is important that this information is given to the office as soon as possible to preserve evidence. All information will be used to review cameras, gate card Trash Talk usage and tele pad calls to homes and the com center to determine the violators. All information will be kept confident. If you are lending your card, entry code or letting someone in for the purpose of using our compactors you are subject to major fines and permanent deactivation of the gate cards used. The person you allow to do this is subject to prosecution for theft of services. Trash Tips: The compactor fills quickly between 3:00 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. weekdays. If you dont like the inconvenience of finding the compactor full, definitely avoid bringing your trash between those hours. Make regular trips to the compactor to avoid hoarding piles of bags and then jamming up the compactor with your deposit. There is some irony to arriving to the compactor and finding a person there complaining that there is no room while they are standing there with their own small landfill of black bags. If you must bring multiple bags of trash, do so on Saturdays or Sundays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. At least there is someone there to compact it giving the members who dont stockpile trash a chance. We have increased from three to four recycling containers. The bins are emptied on Tuesdays and Thursdays each week. We do not recycle electronics except on Dumpster Day. Members have access to recycling 247. There are cut outs at the back for the purpose of depositing recyclables. Unfortunately some members have used these bins as their personal dumpsters. Items such as televisions and other electronics are not to be placed in the bins. We have had to lock down the bins a couple of times because of illegal dumping. If you are found doing this, you will be fined heftily. Please flatten all boxes and be sure to remove Styrofoam forms from packages. Plastic bags except those containing shredded paper are not to be thrown in the recycle bin. If you bring your recyclables in a plastic bag, please either deposit it in the provided bag receptacle or bring it home. Dumpster day is held two times per year, once in the fall and once in the spring. Watch for details regarding the 2018 spring date. We are always looking for volunteers to help.",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2018 PAGE 5 Due to an observable resurgence of trash along our Community roads the following article from 2014 deserves a re-run. The above photos of trash collected by maintenance personnel are from this past November. Trash Revisited Several years ago I wrote an article for the Courier entitled Trash Begets Trash. In its contents I cited the duration of time it takes for various trash items to decomposebiodegrade. At this time I have no intentions of repeating any of that information other than to remind my readers that aluminum foil, plastic bottles and Styrofoam cups are not biodegradable. It is quite obvious to me that many of the litter offenders out there either didnt read my article or just dont give a darn as this continues to be a significant problem along the various roads and common areas of Conashaugh. I want to say that despite the fact that my son and I are growing somewhat weary, the constant new supply of trash will not deter us from our mission of trying to keep the roads litter free. It does, however, continue to boggle my mind that the littering somehow defiles the laws of physics in this community. How else can you explain the mere fact that a person can walk along the road carrying a container full of liquid but once the product is consumed, the empty and obviously lighter weight receptacle can no longer be held on to and must but tossed on the road as if it is too heavy to carry. As I see it, it all comes down to one simple word - RESPECT; respect for the earth, respect for the environment, respect for your community, respect for your friends and neighbors, respect for yourself. In the immortal words of Forrest Gump, Thats all I have to say about that. Annette Musano Please pick up after your dog. No, its not a rule. Its the right thing to do. Thank you. CLC ASSOCIATION",

The courses he took included Plant Life, Landscape Design, Floral Culture, and Architectural Design. We have the evidence of what he has learned in high school at our gates. After high school he went to Westchester University and majored in Education, followed by a four year teaching position. As much as he loved teaching, he thought he would enjoy a more lucrative career in sales. His career, in medical device sales, took him away from Pennsylvania to the Big Apple where he lives now, most of the time. Lucky for us, this is where he met Corey. Corey came to New York City by way of The Green Mountain State of Vermont. That is a lot of nature to leave behind for city life. The purpose of leaving the natural beauty of Bennington was to attend Manhattan College to study Broadcast Journalism. He was an intern and later began his career at MTV. While at MTV he was involved in producing, branding and marketing. Shows such as Mob Wives. WOW! He has since moved on to a different side of the media world working in advertising, heading up social media content. When I tell you they fell in love with Conashaugh Lakes, I mean it, they give our community all theyve got and more. In their down time they are often found roaming the streets of our community looking for the orphans of Conashaugh Trail. By orphans, I mean, the unwanted things that our fellow neighbors throw out the windows of their cars! Just think, if we all took better care of our unwanted things and disposed of them properly, David and Corey would have more time on their hands to put to use other ideas they have for keeping our community naturally beautiful and welcoming. This Dynamic Duo would love to donate their time and expertise to creating a Beautify Conashaugh Lakes Club. They have some fantastic ideas that would require some sweat equity from a few of our neighbors that we would all benefit from. If you have the time, the interest or the desire to join The Dynamic Duo in their pursuit, call me and we can get started immediately! Phone: 570-409-6184. If not, then my suggestion is, the next time you see them collecting those orphans along the side of the road, stop and thank them, they deserve it!

Both my wife and I retired in 2009. Our sons Michael and Christian both went to DVHS and graduated. They went on to attend Drexel University and Penn State. We are very proud of our sons. This past year my son Christian published his novel Human Again after four years of hard work. His book is available on Amazon.com Nook and kindle. And for those who support our local library you can find a hard copy in the Milford and Log Tavern Road branches. Its a well written novel of romance, action and horror. Thank you for reading this article and supporting our son. Albert Santos Editors Note: Here are some reviews from Amazon: Fantastic Read. If I had to compare to existing horror writers, I would say that Stephen King and Clive Barker had a child. I could give a more formal critique but currently I am still running too high on the endorphins pumping through my system having just finished the book. I started reading yesterday. This morning with coffee I thought that I would read some more, having had things to do today. In case you havent figured it out, I did not get to those things. You like horror? Then why are you wasting time reading this review? I dont write horror. This guy does and very well. FAQ- Do I Need a Permit? Spring is a great time for home improvement projects both indoors and out. Below is a partial list of more common projects done by homeowners and require permits from the CLCA Office:  Roof Replacement  Painting exterior of home color approval  Swimming Pools, spas  hot tubs  Fences  Decks  Fire pits  Tree  Brush removal  Major Landscaping projects or to change property grade For tree and brush removal permits simply mark trees and areas with ribbon. Please do not spray paint or use other means of permanent marking. Contact the office and request an inspection. The inspection will be conducted within 10 ten business days.

We filled three cars and delivered boxes and bags filled with much needed clothing and winter items to the community Intervention Center in Scranton. As always, we accept any item and toiletries every day. With the cold temperatures, blankets are in demand! The support weve received has truly touched me and I cant say thank you enough!

Dear Parents  Guardians of Student Walkers This year we have experienced an increase of students walking to and from the CLCA bus lot. Along with that, is an increase of concern for their safety. We have been notified of groups of students walking down the middle of the road or not yielding far enough to the side of the road to allow vehicles to safely pass. The fol- lowing information is from PennDOTs website relating to pedestrian safety:  In the absence of sidewalk and shoulder, pedestrian may walk in road, as close to the edge as practicable and must walk on left side of road facing traffic. Please take a moment and review pe - destrian safety with your child. It is important and applies to everyone. For additional information regarding pedestrian safety please visit https:www. dvrpc.orgtransportationsafetypresentationspdf2009-07Gary_Modi_PennDOT.pdf Thank you.

Following the end of the 2017 season work began to replace plumbing for the pools filtration systems. In addition to those repairs the Board of Directors approved installation of a heating system for the pool that will hopefully allow for more enjoyable experiences for members. The work for the plumbing repairs required removal of the pool deck to access and replace the piping. A new concrete deck will be installed. Due to some extended nice weather a good portion of the pool deck was already poured. The baby pool will also include a water feature. The pool work is being done by Woods Pools. They are the same company that installed the beautiful pool liner a few years back. The work is not yet completed and Woods will be back in the spring. Lets hope for an early one this year! The Rec Building is also in the midst of a much needed facelift. The rear floor to ceiling windows have been removed and replaced with double hung windows. New vinyl siding and trim will be installed along with gutters and downspouts. There will be a new, extended deck on the back as well as a wheel chair ramp along the east side of the building. The construction at the Rec Building is being done by Frank Gorman of FSG Decking and Siding. We were very happy with the beautiful job Frank did with updating the deck at the office and cant wait to see the finished Rec Building project! OUTDOOR  RECREATION Annual Flea Market Scheduled! Each year the Community holds Flea Markets over the Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends. The next Flea Market is scheduled to be held Saturday May 26 th and Sunday May 27 th from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. There is no market held on Memorial Day. This is a free event for our members. Non-members are welcome to sell if they are a guest of and accompanied by a Community Member. Registration is not necessary. If you plan to sell at the Flea Market you will need to bring your own table and chairs. Spaces are first come first served. Please refer to the Flea Market map for areas where vendors are permitted to set up and do not block the area in front of the bus gate as this will be opened for vehicles to enter and exit to the parking areas. Parking can be scarce during the market. Vendors are asked to leave spaces in front of the office area for buyers and to park over in the bus depot area and behind the office. BOARD OF DIRECTOR APPLICATIONS The deadline to submit Board of Director applications for the 20182019 fiscal year is May 1, 2018.

Check us out! facebook.com conashaughlakes September 28 th - Save the Date! CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20192020, Board Candidates and a referendum to vote on a proposal to move the compactor area. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 28th. The meeting will be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Refreshments will be served. Elsewhere in this publication you will find the proposed 20192020 Budget, Candidate bios and details regarding the proposal to move the compactor area. While the proposed 20192020 Budget includes a zero percent increase, which may make you happy, your vote is still very important. Without the memberships participation and a quorum minimum of 10 response there is technically no vote. No vote means no budget and with no budget we cannot operate. So please be sure to vote. All members will receive a ballot in the mail. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you are planning to attend the Annual Meeting you can still mail in your votes. This way if something comes up and you are unable to attend at least your vote makes it to the count. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding the items to be voted. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office.

The Finance Committee would like our Members to have an understanding of our Budget and Reserve Schedules. The following is in an effort to walk you through these two documents and the differences between them. The Budget is for the day to day operation of the community think of it as checkbook for dailymonthly operating expenses and the Reserve schedule is for replacement of large assets such as major building repairs or renovations, trucks and larger equipment replacement think of it as a savings account. Budget: For those of you who may not know this, unlike a number of communities in the area, our members vote on the budget. The CLCA budget is worked on by the Finance Committee. As with all of our Committees, any member in good standing is welcome to attend the meetings. Work on the budget typically begins in June. Averages of actual expenses for the past four years are the starting point to working on the budget. Additional consideration for projected increases or decreases in costs are also looked at and adjusted accordingly. There are two parts to the budget Inflows money in and General Operating expensesmoney out. The totals for each of those sections must be the same. That is a balanced budget. There are 16 lines for inflows including dues. It is important to not confuse Inflows incomemoney in with General Operating Expenses money out last year there was some confusion with this. For example, some members were of the belief that they were being charged and paying for Realtor gate cards. Not true. Realtors pay for realtor cards. Income: There are 16 lines for the income side of the budget. The main source of income is dues. If you look at the bottom right side of the page for the proposed 20192020 Budget you will note the number of homes, lots and contiguous lots. If you take the number from the Homeowners dues inflow line 694,664.00 Budget and Reserves 101 and divide it by the number of homes 568 your answer is 1223.00proposed dues for homes the same math applies for lots and contiguous lots. Dues discount is a projected amount of money that will reduce dues income as a result of members taking advantage of this payment option. Doubtful accounts is the projected amount of money we will not receive from members who fail to pay their dues. This could be for a number of reasons valid and non-valid including but not limited to, foreclosure, bankruptcy, hardship, lack of priorities, abandonment of lots to foreclosure and tax sales. Effort is made whenever legally possible to pursue unpaid dues by the office staff, our attorney and through the legal system. Other Inflowsincome are estimated based on history and projection. Income from resale certificates and transfer fees can fluctuate depending on the home market. Expenses There are 57 expense lines. Y es there are two payroll lines. One is for the office 3 full time and 1 part time on an as needed basis. The second payroll is for maintenance 2 full time and 2-3 part time seasonal employees. Factored in is also overtime for maintenance employees you know when they work through a blizzard or come in at 2 or 3 a.m. to plow your roads and additional part time work for snow clean up during larger snow events. Payroll bonus applies to all permanent employees. Currently there are 9. There are two lines for the Dam. One is for an annual inspection by an engineer, the second is an annual fee we are required to pay the DEP for having a dam. If we dont pay the fee, they breach the dam. We are fortunate that we only have one dam and it is low hazard. We are also fortunate to have not had issues with our dam. One local community has 9 and they have fees applied to each one and, an assessment to pay for several years to fix some of them assessments are over and above dues. There are two road lines. One is for repair of the roads which can include materials such as stone, culvert pipes, wood for guide rails etc. Funds remaining in that line towards the end of the fiscal year can and has been be used to supplement the other fund which is road paving. That line is used for repairing existing roads and when possible paving previously unpaved roads. Miscellaneous expense can cover a number of expenses. Donations to the Fire Department, Humane Society, refreshments for the Annual Meeting are a few examples. In the past donations to the swim team were issued as miscellaneous but that expense is included in the line youth activities. Reserves On the reverse side of the Budget is the General Reserve schedule. This lists CLCAs larger owned assets. Nothing lasts forever and will eventually need to be repaired, roofed, sided, windows, septic, well pumps, restored or totally replaced or expanded. These funds are for that purpose. While we have these items insured, maintenance, deterioration and wear and tear are not covered by insurance. Thanks to reserves, Conashaugh is free of loans and interest payments for those loans. Reserves have also deterred the need to charge members for long term additional assessments. Not too many HOAs can say that. The list is reviewed and items no longer owned andor replaced are removed or updated. Funds for removed items that are no longer needed are redistributed to underfunded lines. Replacement costs will fluctuate and be adjusted up and down as needed. It should also be noted that the schedule of listed assets are periodically reviewed and the replacement cost may need to be adjusted up or down. As for the reserve schedule, the first column after the asset description is the original cost for that item. Last year there was a misunderstanding that CLCA paid 80,000 for a new deck for the office. It is possible to see how that could have been misunderstood. While spending 80,000.00 for a deck may be true in government spending it did not occur here. Please note that the new deck cost was 7510.00. The new deck was simply a reference to the recent work done to that asset the office building. The 80,000.00 on that line was the cost of the building when CLCA purchased it. The amounts funded for certain items were questioned in the past. The funded amounts for the individual line items are not set in stone. In other words, if needed or decided those funds can be moved to another item. An example of what is being said here is as follows: Say that a vehicle or piece of equipment failed beyond repair and replacement was necessary. The replacement cost for that item by either or new or used item is 10,000 but the reserve line for that item was only funded for 5,000.00. The additional 5,000.00 could be moved from another item or items to make up the difference to enable the replacement. Hopefully the above will clarify some of the information concerning the proposed budget and reserve schedule. If you have any questions, please contact the office. Although there is a zero proposed increase, it is very important for the Membership to vote on the budget as well as other matters on the ballot. We must have a budget to operate and a quorum at least 10 of the membership for the vote. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2019 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION 570.618.8055 sosXtremeComfort.com In neighborhoods like yours for 85 years PROPANE No Hidden Fees  No Run Outs HEATING OIL with Anti-gels  Detergents HEATING  COOLING Installations  Repairs This year there will be a referendum on the CLCA Ballot that will include a yes or no vote to move the compactor area from its current location at the Maintenance area to property adjacent to the mailbox area on Conashaugh Trail. On March 10, 2019 there was a meeting held at the Rec Building to discuss this proposed project. A number of concerns and questions were raised at that time. There were 27 members in attendance at the meeting a majority of which live in the vicinity of the proposed area for the project. During that meeting it was proposed that the CLCA Board put the matter to a Community vote. Though the CLCA Board has within its purview to proceed with this project without a vote, it chose to honor the members requests. Why Move The Compactors? Safety. The present location is in a low visibility, high traffic area with a flow of vehicles traveling to and from the member only entrance exit gates combined with the vehicles pulling in and out of the compactor area. There have been accidents in the area involving vehicles hitting other vehicles, fences and the gate. Proximity to baby pool - While there is little affect Annual Meeting Ballot to Include Vote on Relocation of Compactor Area from odors by the main pool area, Members with young children in the baby pool area have complained during hotter weather of odors from the compactor area. The compactor units are less than 30 feet from the baby pool. Recycling and Trash in One Area - Our Members have shown their dedication to recycling, this despite the bins not being located conveniently with the trash. Recycling is a requirement of Pike County. Having the trash and recycling at one location will hopefully encourage those who may not recycle, due to the inconvenience of having to go to two different locations, to join the rest of the Members who do recycle regularly. Our Community Continues to Grow - When the current compactor area was established, there were fewer homes and full time residents. Currently there are 568 homes in our Community with more homes being constructed. A number of foreclosed homes that were previously part time residences are now occupied full time. More people equates to more trash and recycling. Why Not Move them into the Maintenance Yard? The area was explored as an alternative and determined to lack the required space and the safety concerns for our Members and Maintenance employees who operate vehicles and equipment in and out of the yard would not be addressed. Maintenance vehicles and equipment are also stored in the yard. Why not Move Them to Back of The Community? Placing the area in a remote location which is not regularly subject to traffic was determined to not be a solution. Having the area in a place close to an entrance to the Community puts less stress on fewer roadways. Access to electrical utilities is paramount for cost control for the construction and expense in the long run. None of the alternate areas had required utilities readily available. The proposed area will bring convenience, safer travel conditions and security. Members are already traveling in the proposed area whether leaving or arriving to the Community or picking up mail, bus runs or dropping off recycling. Security is also an issue. While it is a small minority of Members, some feel the compactor and recycling area are dumping grounds for their unwanted items including but not limited to electronics, construction debris, appliances, tires and other unwanted debris. Having the area in a remote area will only invite more of this activity. It is also for this reason that we hold volunteer run bi-annual Dumpster Days. Proximity to the office and cameras there will discourage those who have friends who come in from the outside and dump their trash. How Large is the Proposed Area? Conashaugh owns three parcels of land adjacent to the combined lots known as Lot 903A. Lot 903A currently houses the Security and CLCA Office, the busparking lot and mailbox and recycling areas. The project would combine the three additional one plus acre lots known as lots 904,905 and 906 which run along Overbrook Run between Conashaugh Trail and White Tail Lane. The three aforementioned CLCA owned lots would be combined with existing lot 903A to ensure non-sale of the properties to CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2019 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION others for development. The total area of the proposed project would be less than one acre occupying an area immediately adjacent to the parking lot for the mail boxes. Are all of the Trees on the Lots Going to Be Cut down? No. Only trees needed to accommodate the area and an access lane for pick-up of trash and recyclables will be removed. The area will be buffered by trees on the Conashaugh Trail and Overbrook Run sides of the facility. Plans also include fencing and landscaping. Will There be Garbage Trucks Coming and Going All Hours of the Day and Night? A Compactor is pulled when it is full to capacity. Currently we are experiencing three sometimes four trucks per month for the purpose of pulling trash compactors. Recycling is collected twice per week Mondays and Thursdays. Trash and Recycling trucks are not permitted in the Community before 8 a.m. Any deviance to this rule is quickly addressed with the hauler. There may be a rare occasion due to emergency where a trash compactor is pulled on a Saturday. The future installation of a third compactor for recycling will reduce the number of trucks for recycling from eight visits per month to approximately two visits. Is it Going to Smell? Garbage smells. That is a fact. Is the neighborhood going to reek? No. There are homes much closer to the current location than the proposed location that do not report it as objectionable. Why Dont We Just Have Curbside Pick Up Would you survive having one can of garbage picked up once per week? Based on the number of bags often observed being brought in on a single deposit, the answer would likely be, not a chance. If you think we have bears now, curbside pick up would be a dinner bell to our furry friends. What About Bears? We live in the woods. We have trash. Bears like trash. Last year we had a record number of bear sightings and yes, they liked to visit the compactors, especially one mother and her cubs. This year in comparison we have had very few reports of bears with the exception of properties closer to the State lands and one reported sighting at the compactor. Bears will check out an area and if they are not successful in getting a food prize, will move on. HintOne of the reasons members are asked to not leave trash on the ground or the compactor doors open. How is this Project Being Funded? The estimated cost for this project is 140,000.00. Funds from the CLCA Capital Improvement and General Reserve Funds will be utilized for the construction of the project. Why Will it Cost So Much? Relocation will involve more than moving the compactors from one location to another. Tree cutting, excavating, electric service, pads, paving, retaining walls and landscaping will all be needed. How is the Project Going to Be Designed? The services of MEP Designs of Spring Brook Pa were utilized to prepare drawings for the project which was modeled from a project completed by them at Pocono Woodland Lakes. Tony Caputo of MEP attended the March 10 meeting to explain the project, review the design and answer questions concerning the project. The area is designed to hold three compactors, two for trash and one for recycling. Our two existing compactors will be relocated and adapted for the area and a third areapad and electrical set up will be constructed for future placement for a third compactor for recycling. There will be a one way, paved drive up ramp to the compactor units. It will run alongside and in the same travel direction as the existing parking lot for the mailboxes. The compacting units and compactor boxes will be adjacent to but lower than the ramp. Depositing trash in the proposed area will be different than our current set up with on grade access for depositing trash. Our current compactors will be fitted with chutes that have doors. Trash is deposited down a chute leading into the compactor box. This new proposed access will eliminate the need to drag trash bags along the ground for a distance, heave it over the door or over the users head. It will also eliminate debris that is left when someone misses their toss and their bag rips leaving residue all over the ground. The compactors and boxes will be sealed to prevent leakage. Removal of the compactors will be done using an access drive from Overbrook Run. The drive will be for that purpose only and not for use by members. It will be gated to prevent entry from Overbrook Run except by the hauler or maintenance. Will The Compactor Hours be the Same? It is very likely that there will be reduced hours for the Compactor regardless of the outcome of the relocation vote to ensure security of the area and prevent illegal dumping by outsiders and some residents. Compactor use is being monitored for activity and peak times. Any schedule changes will be announced. Hopefully this message provides enough information for members to feel informed about and make a decision regarding this proposed project. We understand that there are compassionate Community Members on both sides of the project. Whether you are for or against this project, it is important to vote. Let the vote be cast and not be complacent. Typically the board would make decisions like this with limited Membership input as it is chartered to do but did not and left it to the people. The Community was given the opportunity to vote on previous matters involving ATVs and other off-road vehicles in the past. The vote went forward and very few voted including those who vocalized for and against the ban on these vehicles. It was by a very small margin between a little more than 10 of the members voting. Another year a vote was put out to the Membership to build a new Recreation Center. This proposal was defeated, with more voters responding but not a whole lot more. Bottom line is if you dont vote, dont criticize the results. P l e a s e re m o v e a l l S t y ro f o a m a n d f l a t t e n a l l b o x e s w h e n re c y c l i n g.

Are you storing your boatkayak on the racks located by the tennis courts? Have you already responded to requests to contact the office? If your answer to these questions are yes and no, then you need to keep on reading. If you answered yes to both of the questions, theres no need to read further. We have a demand for boat storage on the rack but have run out of space. An inventory of boats stored on the CLCA rack has been ongoing since mid-June. Messages were sent on the LOOP and Facebook as well as posted on the boat rack and large bulletin board at the mailbox area entrance. Please take a look at the diagram and photo with this article and let us know which boat is yours. You can respond by email to clcalooppdt.net, via Facebook messenger to our Conashaugh page  https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes or you can call or visit the office. We will need your information including name and lot number along with the slot number where your boat is located ie..John Doe, Lot 1234, slot C-15. The waiting list for storage is growing. This survey will end September 15 th after which time unclaimed vessels will be removed. If you see what appears to be an abandoned spot, please do not move in until the space is assigned to you regardless of whether or not you are on the wait - ing list. If you would like to go on the list, please contact the office. If you move, dont forget your boat! Thank you. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank all CLCA members who made contributions to my Eagle Scout project and all those who patronized my concession stand at the pool this summer. You were a vital part in my fund raising. Please come and enjoy the updated childrensroom at the Dingmans Library of which I hope to complete the project in the early fall. Again, I thank you.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2019 PAGE 7 CLC ASSOCIATION Taking a Look at Dues History Each year CLCA members are asked to vote on proposed dues for the upcoming year. The proposed budget is prepared annually by the Finance Committee and presented to the Board for review. Once it is approved by the Board it is then presented to the membership for its review and vote. There was some debate heard through the grapevine regarding how dues are determined each year. Some inquired as to how dues are prepared, others believed that money is automatically added to the previous year while others predict dues reaching sky high into the thousands of dollars within a short few years. As you may have read elsewhere in this issue of the Courier, the proposed 20192020 CLCA budget contains a zero increase from last years dues. Below is a thirteen year history of CLCA dues: 2019 0 2018 2 2017 2 2016 1 2015 1 2014 1 2013 1.75 2012 2 2011 1.75 2010 1.75 2009 0 2008 5.5 2007 9.45 Dear Parents and Guardians Please have a serious conversation with your children about water safety, including the dangers of walking on frozen lakes and waterways. Although we are a private Community we are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. They have full access to the Community and do come in to enforce rules including but not limited to possession of fishing licenses and boat safety equipment. Be aware of life jacket and safety equipment that is required when on the water. All children 12 years of age and younger on all Commonwealth waters must wear a life jacket while underway on any boat 20 feet in length or less and on all canoes and kayaks. Underway includes drifting boats. For boating and fishing rules please visit https:www.fishandboat.comPages default.aspx Although we are not in ice season, it will come soon enough. Cold water can kill quickly. A potentially serious outcome was averted a during a thaw period this past winter thanks to Legion Security Officer Michelle Stanzione being in the right place at the right time. While patrolling she came upon resident children who ventured out on Seneca Lake. Her quick calm response and actions helped two of three resident youths who fell through the ice. Thankfully no one was injured in the incident. The colder temperatures may create what appears to be safe ice. For information on ice safety visit, https:www.fishandboat.comFishFishingPages IceWinterFishing.aspx. Water and Ice Safety Friendly Reminder If you are planning to pave your driveway, please contact the office for a no cost inspection by maintenance. This inspection is to determine if you need to install or replace a culvert pipe. Please do this in advance of arranging a date for paving. Thank you.

Im running for a position on the CLCA Board this September and would like to introduce myself if we havent already met. Seventeen years ago my husband Jim and I moved to Conashaugh Lakes with our 4 children. Born and raised in New Jersey, we looked forward to a piece of tranquility to call home and thankfully we found it here. In the past, Ive had the privilege of serving on 2 committees within Conashaugh - Security as well as Design and Review. I believe its important and most beneficial to volunteer whenever possible. Ive also volunteered my time in several areas including 12 years as a CCD teacher, both in New Jersey and here at St. Vincents. 11 years as a Girl Scout Leader, 7 years as a Boy Scout Leader, and 4 years in an AOL online forum which eventually turned into a paid position as an Administrator of over 17,000 forum employees. I currently work from home which has afforded me the ability to care for our two disabled adult sons. My interests in this association are to maintain the integrity of the board, listen to and consider the interests of the members of this community, to volunteer and have the privilege to serve while keeping the best interests of this community as a whole. I would be honored to have your vote this September. Kurt Budveit I have lived in Conashaugh Lakes for eighteen years and was appointed to the Board earlier this fiscal year. I currently am serving as liaison for the Maintenance Committee and previously was a member of the Rules and Regulations Committee. I look forward to continuing my service to this Community and doing my part for it to remain a safe, clean and great place to live without too many restrictions or unnecessary expense. Patti Havekost Hi everyone my name is Patti Havekost. Come September 12th I will have lived here 30 years. Most of you dont know me as my children are now 30 and 28 years old. Over these last thirty years I have volunteered in our Community. I ran the Recreation Committee many of those years. This year I was appointed to the Board and I was ready to participate in the larger decisions of the Community with no personal agenda. I want to make sure this Community continues with the integrity that it has been known to have. We have a gem here that is one of the best and I hope to help make it a little better. I hope to meet you at the Annual Meeting. Take the time and come, its one morning out of a whole year. Gary Linton My family and I have been residents of the Conashaugh Lakes Community since December of 2014. I have and continue to serve on our Security Committee. I retired from the Orange County Sheriff s Department in New York as an Investigator and went on to join the managerial work force for Chambers of Commerce, non-profit organizations, community management and also took on the Chief of Public Safety position at a local community where I was injured causing me to permanently retire from law enforcement. I am presently the Executive Director of the Wayne Pike Adult Literacy Program in Honesdale. My experience as a Director and being affiliated with many Boards for these organizations, as well as my law enforcement experience, has given me a good foundation to be a beneficial addition to the Board. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2019 PAGE 13 CONASHAUGH NEWS Burning Within the Community Mind if I smoke?  I dont care if you burn. Anyone whos ever been a Honeymooners fan is familiar with that line. Some members here are of the misunderstanding that having a campfire in your yard is not permitted. Lets douse that one. Youre allowed to burn but there are a few simple procedures to follow. All residents wishing to use burn barrels or campfire pits need to contact the office for a permit. It is a free, one-time process. The permit includes procedures to follow to ensure safety. It is important to call Pike County Communications 570296-7700 each time you burn. This is required by Dingman Township. You also need to call Security 570 686-1130. When calling Security, you do not have to speak to a live person. Wait for the beep and leave a message that you are burning which includes your name, time, lot number and 911 address. Calling the Com Center is important. By doing so you are helping prevent the possibility of a false alarm being responded to in the event that someone sees the fire and believes it to not be a controlled situation and calling 911. Our Township Fire Department consists of volunteers who are stretched thin enough without having to be called to a campfire. When burning please be considerate of your neighbors. There are many homes with open windows or people outside enjoying their own backyards. Never burn garbage, furniture, building materials or caustic materials. Use a burn barrel or closed campfire ring. A burning heap that rivals a Viking funeral is not a campfire. Be cognizant that what you burn into and leave on the ground has a good chance to one day end up in your well. There is no burning of tree stumps and brush without written permission from Conashaugh Lakes. Keep a hose at the site. Most importantly be aware of conditions before you burn and obey all burn bans that may be in effect. You can find out about burn bans by visiting the Dingman Township Fire Department website at http:www.dingmanfire.comBurning20Ban.htm. By following these simple steps you can enjoy your fire while ensuring safety to your neighbors as well first responders by not having to be called out to a friendly fire. All members receiving mail in Conashaugh Lakes must be sure to update your mailing information with your billing companies, the tax collector or anyone else who may be sending. We have been advised by the post office that mail addressed to a four digit Conashaugh mailbox will be returned to the senders.

It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20192020, Board Candidates and a referendum to vote on a proposal to move the compactor area. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September which this year falls on September 28th. The meeting will be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall which is located just south of Conashaugh. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Refreshments will be served. Elsewhere in this publication you will find the proposed 20192020 Budget, Candidate bios and details regarding the proposal to move the compactor area. While the proposed 20192020 Budget includes a zero percent increase, which may make you happy, your vote is still very important. Without the memberships participation and a quorum minimum of 10 response there is technically no vote. No vote means no budget and with no budget we cannot operate. So please be sure to vote. All members will receive a ballot in the mail. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you are planning to attend the Annual Meeting you can still mail in your votes. This way if something comes up and you are unable to attend at least your vote makes it to the count. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding the items to be voted. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office.",

Automatic Generator Systems  Ductless Heating  Cooling  Electrical Services Professional Service for Over 30 Years 0 Financing 570-698-9696 GORINKERINC.COM Sometime in mid to late August you will be receiving a packet in the mail that will contain information regarding the CLCA Annual Meeting which will take place Saturday September 28th, 2019. Included in that packet will be the 20192020 Proposed Budget and the CLCA Reserve schedule. The proposed budget is for a ZERO increase this year. The Finance Committee would like our Members to have an understanding of our Budget and Reserve Schedules. The following is in an effort to walk you through these two documents and the differences between them. The Budget is for the day to day operation of the community think of it as checkbook for dailymonthly operating expenses and the Reserve schedule is for replacement of large assets such as major building repairs or renovations, trucks and larger equipment replacement think of it as a savings account. Budget: For those of you who may not know this, unlike a number of communities in the area, our members vote on the budget. The CLCA budget is worked on by the Finance Committee. As with all of our Committees, any member in good standing is welcome to attend the meetings. Work on the budget typically begins in June. Averages of actual expenses for the past four years are the starting point to working on the budget. Additional consideration for projected increases or decreases in costs are also looked at and adjusted accordingly. There are two parts to the budget Inflows money in and General Operating expensesmoney out. The totals for each of those sections must be the same. That is a balanced budget. There are 16 lines for inflows including dues. It is important to not confuse Inflows incomemoney in with General Operating Expenses money out last year there was some confusion with this. For example, some members were of the belief that they were being charged and paying for Realtor gate cards. Not true. Realtors pay for realtor cards. Income: There are 16 lines for the income side of the budget. The main source of income is dues. If you look at the bottom right side of the page for the proposed 20192020 Budget you will note the number of homes, lots and contiguous lots. If you take the number from the Homeowners dues inflow line 694,664.00 Budget and Reserves 101 and divide it by the number of homes 568 your answer is 1223.00proposed dues for homes the same math applies for lots and contiguous lots. Dues discount is a projected amount of money that will reduce dues income as a result of members taking advantage of this payment option. Doubtful accounts is the projected amount of money we will not receive from members who fail to pay their dues. This could be for a number of reasons valid and non-valid including but not limited to, foreclosure, bankruptcy, hardship, lack of priorities, abandonment of lots to foreclosure and tax sales. Effort is made whenever legally possible to pursue unpaid dues by the office staff, our attorney and through the legal system. Other Inflowsincome are estimated based on history and projection. Income from resale certificates and transfer fees can fluctuate depending on the home market. Expenses There are 57 expense lines. Y es there are two payroll lines. One is for the office 3 full time and 1 part time on an as needed basis. The second payroll is for maintenance 2 full time and 2-3 part time seasonal employees. Factored in is also overtime for maintenance employees you know when they work through a blizzard or come in at 2 or 3 a.m. to plow your roads and additional part time work for snow clean up during larger snow events. Payroll bonus applies to all permanent employees. Currently there are 9. There are two lines for the Dam. One is for an annual inspection by an engineer, the second is an annual fee we are required to pay the DEP for having a dam. If we dont pay the fee, they breach the dam. We are fortunate that we only have one dam and it is low hazard. We are also fortunate to have not had issues with our dam. One local community has 9 and they have fees applied to each one and, an assessment to pay for several years to fix some of them assessments are over and above dues. There are two road lines. One is for repair of the roads which can include materials such as stone, culvert pipes, wood for guide rails etc. Funds remaining in that line towards the end of the fiscal year can and has been be used to supplement the other fund which is road paving. That line is used for repairing existing roads and when possible paving previously unpaved roads. Miscellaneous expense can cover a number of expenses. Donations to the Fire Department, Humane Society, refreshments for the Annual Meeting are a few examples. In the past donations to the swim team were issued as miscellaneous but that expense is included in the line youth activities. Reserves On the reverse side of the Budget is the General Reserve schedule. This lists CLCAs larger owned assets. Nothing lasts forever and will eventually need to be repaired, roofed, sided, windows, septic, well pumps, restored or totally replaced or expanded. These funds are for that purpose. While we have these items insured, maintenance, deterioration and wear and tear are not covered by insurance. Thanks to reserves, Conashaugh is free of loans and interest payments for those loans. Reserves have also deterred the need to charge members for long term additional assessments. Not too many HOAs can say that. The list is reviewed and items no longer owned andor replaced are removed or updated. Funds for removed items that are no longer needed are redistributed to underfunded lines. Replacement costs will fluctuate and be adjusted up and down as needed. It should also be noted that the schedule of listed assets are periodically reviewed and the replacement cost may need to be adjusted up or down. As for the reserve schedule, the first column after the asset description is the original cost for that item. Last year there was a misunderstanding that CLCA paid 80,000 for a new deck for the office. It is possible to see how that could have been misunderstood. While spending 80,000.00 for a deck may be true in government spending it did not occur here. Please note that the new deck cost was 7510.00. The new deck was simply a reference to the recent work done to that asset the office building. The 80,000.00 on that line was the cost of the building when CLCA purchased it. The amounts funded for certain items were questioned in the past. The funded amounts for the individual line items are not set in stone. In other words, if needed or decided those funds can be moved to another item. An example of what is being said here is as follows: Say that a vehicle or piece of equipment failed beyond repair and replacement was necessary. The replacement cost for that item by either or new or used item is 10,000 but the reserve line for that item was only funded for 5,000.00. The additional 5,000.00 could be moved from another item or items to make up the difference to enable the replacement. Hopefully the above will clarify some of the information concerning the proposed budget and reserve schedule. If you have any questions, please contact the office. Although there is a zero proposed increase, it is very important for the Membership to vote on the budget as well as other matters on the ballot. We must have a budget to operate and a quorum at least 10 of the membership for the vote.",

On March 10, 2019 there was a meeting held at the Rec Building to discuss this proposed project. A number of concerns and questions were raised at that time. There were 27 members in attendance at the meeting a majority of which live in the vicinity of the proposed area for the project. During that meeting it was proposed that the CLCA Board put the matter to a Community vote. Though the CLCA Board has within its purview to proceed with this project without a vote, it chose to honor the members requests. Why Move The Compactors? Safety. The present location is in a low visibility, high traffic area with a flow of vehicles traveling to and from the member only entrance exit gates combined with the vehicles pulling in and out of the compactor area. There have been accidents in the area involving vehicles hitting other vehicles, fences and the gate. Proximity to baby pool - While there is little affect Annual Meeting Ballot to Include Vote on Relocation of Compactor Area from odors by the main pool area, Members with young children in the baby pool area have complained during hotter weather of odors from the compactor area. The compactor units are less than 30 feet from the baby pool. Recycling and Trash in One Area - Our Members have shown their dedication to recycling, this despite the bins not being located conveniently with the trash. Recycling is a requirement of Pike County. Having the trash and recycling at one location will hopefully encourage those who may not recycle, due to the inconvenience of having to go to two different locations, to join the rest of the Members who do recycle regularly. Our Community Continues to Grow - When the current compactor area was established, there were fewer homes and full time residents. Currently there are 568 homes in our Community with more homes being constructed. A number of foreclosed homes that were previously part time residences are now occupied full time. More people equates to more trash and recycling. Why Not Move them into the Maintenance Yard? The area was explored as an alternative and determined to lack the required space and the safety concerns for our Members and Maintenance employees who operate vehicles and equipment in and out of the yard would not be addressed. Maintenance vehicles and equipment are also stored in the yard. Why not Move Them to Back of The Community? Placing the area in a remote location which is not regularly subject to traffic was determined to not be a solution. Having the area in a place close to an entrance to the Community puts less stress on fewer roadways. Access to electrical utilities is paramount for cost control for the construction and expense in the long run. None of the alternate areas had required utilities readily available. The proposed area will bring convenience, safer travel conditions and security. Members are already traveling in the proposed area whether leaving or arriving to the Community or picking up mail, bus runs or dropping off recycling. Security is also an issue. While it is a small minority of Members, some feel the compactor and recycling area are dumping grounds for their unwanted items including but not limited to electronics, construction debris, appliances, tires and other unwanted debris. Having the area in a remote area will only invite more of this activity. It is also for this reason that we hold volunteer run bi-annual Dumpster Days. Proximity to the office and cameras there will discourage those who have friends who come in from the outside and dump their trash. How Large is the Proposed Area? Conashaugh owns three parcels of land adjacent to the combined lots known as Lot 903A. Lot 903A currently houses the Security and CLCA Office, the busparking lot and mailbox and recycling areas. The project would combine the three additional one plus acre lots known as lots 904,905 and 906 which run along Overbrook Run between Conashaugh Trail and White Tail Lane. The three aforementioned CLCA owned lots would be combined with existing lot 903A to ensure non-sale of the properties to",

The total area of the proposed project would be less than one acre occupying an area immediately adjacent to the parking lot for the mail boxes. Are all of the Trees on the Lots Going to Be Cut down? No. Only trees needed to accommodate the area and an access lane for pick-up of trash and recyclables will be removed. The area will be buffered by trees on the Conashaugh Trail and Overbrook Run sides of the facility. Plans also include fencing and landscaping. Will There be Garbage Trucks Coming and Going All Hours of the Day and Night? A Compactor is pulled when it is full to capacity. Currently we are experiencing three sometimes four trucks per month for the purpose of pulling trash compactors. Recycling is collected twice per week Mondays and Thursdays. Trash and Recycling trucks are not permitted in the Community before 8 a.m. Any deviance to this rule is quickly addressed with the hauler. There may be a rare occasion due to emergency where a trash compactor is pulled on a Saturday. The future installation of a third compactor for recycling will reduce the number of trucks for recycling from eight visits per month to approximately two visits. Is it Going to Smell? Garbage smells. That is a fact. Is the neighborhood going to reek? No. There are homes much closer to the current location than the proposed location that do not report it as objectionable. Why Dont We Just Have Curbside Pick Up Would you survive having one can of garbage picked up once per week? Based on the number of bags often observed being brought in on a single deposit, the answer would likely be, not a chance. If you think we have bears now, curbside pick up would be a dinner bell to our furry friends. What About Bears? We live in the woods. We have trash. Bears like trash. Last year we had a record number of bear sightings and yes, they liked to visit the compactors, especially one mother and her cubs. This year in comparison we have had very few reports of bears with the exception of properties closer to the State lands and one reported sighting at the compactor. Bears will check out an area and if they are not successful in getting a food prize, will move on. HintOne of the reasons members are asked to not leave trash on the ground or the compactor doors open. How is this Project Being Funded? The estimated cost for this project is 140,000.00. Funds from the CLCA Capital Improvement and General Reserve Funds will be utilized for the construction of the project. Why Will it Cost So Much? Relocation will involve more than moving the compactors from one location to another. Tree cutting, excavating, electric service, pads, paving, retaining walls and landscaping will all be needed. How is the Project Going to Be Designed? The services of MEP Designs of Spring Brook Pa were utilized to prepare drawings for the project which was modeled from a project completed by them at Pocono Woodland Lakes. Tony Caputo of MEP attended the March 10 meeting to explain the project, review the design and answer questions concerning the project. The area is designed to hold three compactors, two for trash and one for recycling. Our two existing compactors will be relocated and adapted for the area and a third areapad and electrical set up will be constructed for future placement for a third compactor for recycling. There will be a one way, paved drive up ramp to the compactor units. It will run alongside and in the same travel direction as the existing parking lot for the mailboxes. The compacting units and compactor boxes will be adjacent to but lower than the ramp. Depositing trash in the proposed area will be different than our current set up with on grade access for depositing trash. Our current compactors will be fitted with chutes that have doors. Trash is deposited down a chute leading into the compactor box. This new proposed access will eliminate the need to drag trash bags along the ground for a distance, heave it over the door or over the users head. It will also eliminate debris that is left when someone misses their toss and their bag rips leaving residue all over the ground. The compactors and boxes will be sealed to prevent leakage. Removal of the compactors will be done using an access drive from Overbrook Run. The drive will be for that purpose only and not for use by members. It will be gated to prevent entry from Overbrook Run except by the hauler or maintenance. Will The Compactor Hours be the Same? It is very likely that there will be reduced hours for the Compactor regardless of the outcome of the relocation vote to ensure security of the area and prevent illegal dumping by outsiders and some residents. Compactor use is being monitored for activity and peak times. Any schedule changes will be announced. Hopefully this message provides enough information for members to feel informed about and make a decision regarding this proposed project. We understand that there are compassionate Community Members on both sides of the project. Whether you are for or against this project, it is important to vote. Let the vote be cast and not be complacent. Typically the board would make decisions like this with limited Membership input as it is chartered to do but did not and left it to the people. The Community was given the opportunity to vote on previous matters involving ATVs and other off-road vehicles in the past. The vote went forward and very few voted including those who vocalized for and against the ban on these vehicles. It was by a very small margin between a little more than 10 of the members voting. Another year a vote was put out to the Membership to build a new Recreation Center. This proposal was defeated, with more voters responding but not a whole lot more. Bottom line is if you dont vote, dont criticize the results. P l e a s e re m o v e a l l S t y ro f o a m a n d f l a t t e n a l l b o x e s w h e n re c y c l i n g.

If there is not enough parking in the school bus lot, parking in the mailbox area is permitted, however, do not block mailbox parking lot aisles or park in the area reserved for small buses. Please note that in the afternoon small buses will be dropping off their passengers in the mailbox lot. The area to the right side of the lot as you are approaching the mailbox area exit is reserved for parking for those buses and people picking up students who are on them. Others are asked not to park in this area. In the event that you are running late for a pick-up in the afternoon, let your child know that they are welcome to wait in the office until a ride arrives. There are quite a few new families in our community and others new to the bus stop experience. Please be courteous and helpful to others. The first days of school are hectic and many parents come to the lot to experience this exciting day. If you have any questions, please contact the office 686-4000. Thank you! Thank You! Are you storing your boatkayak on the racks located by the tennis courts? Have you already responded to requests to contact the office? If your answer to these questions are yes and no, then you need to keep on reading. If you answered yes to both of the questions, theres no need to read further. We have a demand for boat storage on the rack but have run out of space. An inventory of boats stored on the CLCA rack has been ongoing since mid-June. Messages were sent on the LOOP and Facebook as well as posted on the boat rack and large bulletin board at the mailbox area entrance. Please take a look at the diagram and photo with this article and let us know which boat is yours. You can respond by email to clcalooppdt.net, via Facebook messenger to our Conashaugh page  https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes or you can call or visit the office. We will need your information including name and lot number along with the slot number where your boat is located ie..John Doe, Lot 1234, slot C-15. The waiting list for storage is growing. This survey will end September 15 th after which time unclaimed vessels will be removed. If you see what appears to be an abandoned spot, please do not move in until the space is assigned to you regardless of whether or not you are on the wait - ing list. If you would like to go on the list, please contact the office. If you move, dont forget your boat! Thank you. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank all CLCA members who made contributions to my Eagle Scout project and all those who patronized my concession stand at the pool this summer. You were a vital part in my fund raising. Please come and enjoy the updated childrensroom at the Dingmans Library of which I hope to complete the project in the early fall. Again, I thank you.

The proposed budget is prepared annually by the Finance Committee and presented to the Board for review. Once it is approved by the Board it is then presented to the membership for its review and vote. There was some debate heard through the grapevine regarding how dues are determined each year. Some inquired as to how dues are prepared, others believed that money is automatically added to the previous year while others predict dues reaching sky high into the thousands of dollars within a short few years. As you may have read elsewhere in this issue of the Courier, the proposed 20192020 CLCA budget contains a zero increase from last years dues. Below is a thirteen year history of CLCA dues: 2019 0 2018 2 2017 2 2016 1 2015 1 2014 1 2013 1.75 2012 2 2011 1.75 2010 1.75 2009 0 2008 5.5 2007 9.45 Dear Parents and Guardians Please have a serious conversation with your children about water safety, including the dangers of walking on frozen lakes and waterways. Although we are a private Community we are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. They have full access to the Community and do come in to enforce rules including but not limited to possession of fishing licenses and boat safety equipment. Be aware of life jacket and safety equipment that is required when on the water. All children 12 years of age and younger on all Commonwealth waters must wear a life jacket while underway on any boat 20 feet in length or less and on all canoes and kayaks. Underway includes drifting boats. For boating and fishing rules please visit https:www.fishandboat.comPages default.aspx Although we are not in ice season, it will come soon enough. Cold water can kill quickly. A potentially serious outcome was averted a during a thaw period this past winter thanks to Legion Security Officer Michelle Stanzione being in the right place at the right time. While patrolling she came upon resident children who ventured out on Seneca Lake. Her quick calm response and actions helped two of three resident youths who fell through the ice. Thankfully no one was injured in the incident. The colder temperatures may create what appears to be safe ice. For information on ice safety visit, https:www.fishandboat.comFishFishingPages IceWinterFishing.aspx. Water and Ice Safety Friendly Reminder If you are planning to pave your driveway, please contact the office for a no cost inspection by maintenance. This inspection is to determine if you need to install or replace a culvert pipe. Please do this in advance of arranging a date for paving. Thank you.",

Im running for a position on the CLCA Board this September and would like to introduce myself if we havent already met. Seventeen years ago my husband Jim and I moved to Conashaugh Lakes with our 4 children. Born and raised in New Jersey, we looked forward to a piece of tranquility to call home and thankfully we found it here. In the past, Ive had the privilege of serving on 2 committees within Conashaugh - Security as well as Design and Review. I believe its important and most beneficial to volunteer whenever possible. Ive also volunteered my time in several areas including 12 years as a CCD teacher, both in New Jersey and here at St. Vincents. 11 years as a Girl Scout Leader, 7 years as a Boy Scout Leader, and 4 years in an AOL online forum which eventually turned into a paid position as an Administrator of over 17,000 forum employees. I currently work from home which has afforded me the ability to care for our two disabled adult sons. My interests in this association are to maintain the integrity of the board, listen to and consider the interests of the members of this community, to volunteer and have the privilege to serve while keeping the best interests of this community as a whole. I would be honored to have your vote this September. Kurt Budveit I have lived in Conashaugh Lakes for eighteen years and was appointed to the Board earlier this fiscal year. I currently am serving as liaison for the Maintenance Committee and previously was a member of the Rules and Regulations Committee. I look forward to continuing my service to this Community and doing my part for it to remain a safe, clean and great place to live without too many restrictions or unnecessary expense. Patti Havekost Hi everyone my name is Patti Havekost. Come September 12th I will have lived here 30 years. Most of you dont know me as my children are now 30 and 28 years old. Over these last thirty years I have volunteered in our Community. I ran the Recreation Committee many of those years. This year I was appointed to the Board and I was ready to participate in the larger decisions of the Community with no personal agenda. I want to make sure this Community continues with the integrity that it has been known to have. We have a gem here that is one of the best and I hope to help make it a little better. I hope to meet you at the Annual Meeting. Take the time and come, its one morning out of a whole year. Gary Linton My family and I have been residents of the Conashaugh Lakes Community since December of 2014. I have and continue to serve on our Security Committee. I retired from the Orange County Sheriff s Department in New York as an Investigator and went on to join the managerial work force for Chambers of Commerce, non-profit organizations, community management and also took on the Chief of Public Safety position at a local community where I was injured causing me to permanently retire from law enforcement. I am presently the Executive Director of the Wayne Pike Adult Literacy Program in Honesdale. My experience as a Director and being affiliated with many Boards for these organizations, as well as my law enforcement experience, has given me a good foundation to be a beneficial addition to the Board.",

Anyone whos ever been a Honeymooners fan is familiar with that line. Some members here are of the misunderstanding that having a campfire in your yard is not permitted. Lets douse that one. Youre allowed to burn but there are a few simple procedures to follow. All residents wishing to use burn barrels or campfire pits need to contact the office for a permit. It is a free, one-time process. The permit includes procedures to follow to ensure safety. It is important to call Pike County Communications 570296-7700 each time you burn. This is required by Dingman Township. You also need to call Security 570 686-1130. When calling Security, you do not have to speak to a live person. Wait for the beep and leave a message that you are burning which includes your name, time, lot number and 911 address. Calling the Com Center is important. By doing so you are helping prevent the possibility of a false alarm being responded to in the event that someone sees the fire and believes it to not be a controlled situation and calling 911. Our Township Fire Department consists of volunteers who are stretched thin enough without having to be called to a campfire. When burning please be considerate of your neighbors. There are many homes with open windows or people outside enjoying their own backyards. Never burn garbage, furniture, building materials or caustic materials. Use a burn barrel or closed campfire ring. A burning heap that rivals a Viking funeral is not a campfire. Be cognizant that what you burn into and leave on the ground has a good chance to one day end up in your well. There is no burning of tree stumps and brush without written permission from Conashaugh Lakes. Keep a hose at the site. Most importantly be aware of conditions before you burn and obey all burn bans that may be in effect. You can find out about burn bans by visiting the Dingman Township Fire Department website at http:www.dingmanfire.comBurning20Ban.htm. By following these simple steps you can enjoy your fire while ensuring safety to your neighbors as well first responders by not having to be called out to a friendly fire. All members receiving mail in Conashaugh Lakes must be sure to update your mailing information with your billing companies, the tax collector or anyone else who may be sending. We have been advised by the post office that mail addressed to a four digit Conashaugh mailbox will be returned to the senders.

Most of us are inspired by the beauty of The Pocono Mountains and the serene life in Conashaugh Lakes. Others, like Dawn Lombard, have plotted and planned their exodus from traffic, high taxes and noise. For Dawn, it had a lot to do with all of the above, however, she was also attracted to Pike County due to its proximity to several Artisan venues. Peters Valley School of Craft in Layton, New Jersey and Pike County Arts and Crafts in Milford, Pennsylvania, just to name two that played a role in her choice of location. When she was in high school she found that she was challenged to complete her yearend art project. This final project of an ocean view had to be helped along by her mother. Although she felt that she didnt have any artistic talent, as a college student she majored in Studio Art. She thought there was beauty in taking raw materials and creating art. She eventually changed her major to business and then received her MBA in International Marketing. Her artistic side remained dormant while she worked in the corporate world for almost twenty five years. Dawn spent a lot of time feeling the stress that many people experience with the demands of their job. When her sister approached her in 2002 to take a glass bead course she jumped at the opportunity. The minute she put the torch to glass she knew that she found her escape from corporate life. The class she took was in Lampworking which is an old art form which is believed to have its roots in Italy. It is called Lampworking because, originally these glass pieces were made using a lamp to melt and shape the glass. Within the last twenty years there has been a resurgence of artists like Dawn, who are bringing the beauty of Lampworking back to life. She began to realize that she was going thru the motions at work but really wanted to spend her time creating art. She couldnt wait to get home from work so she could spend some quiet time developing her skills in Lampworking. In 2004 she was able to set up a home studio. She would spend her nights and weekends creating art and business days working in the corporate world dreaming about her studio art. 2006 was the turning point in her artistry. She was producing work that was being shown in nationally acclaimed juried shows. In 2015 with a few awards to her name, she transitioned An Artisan Amongst Us BY VALERIE FERLAUTO CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2019 PAGE 2 CLC ASSOCIATION Conashaugh is on FACEBOOK!

Important Reminders Regarding Snow  Other Weather Events Snow Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicles back a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Remove all basketball hoops and other sport equipment from the roads. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads or in the bus parking lot. Severe weather may result in the closure of compactors. Power Outages During a power outage all of the entry and exit gates go into the up position. The gates have back up batteries that allow for this to happen instead of staying in the down position. Gates cannot be manually lifted or operated without power. Once power is restored the gates will return to the down position. The compactors cannot operate without power therefore they will be closed. Please hold trash until the power is restored and the compactors can be reopened. Do not leave trash outside the gate or throw it in the recycle bins. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2019 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Shop Local SUPPORT THE LOCAL BUSINESSES FEATURED IN THE CONASHAUGH COURIER Meeting to Review and Discuss Compactor Project Set for March 10 Engineer Tony Caputo of MEP Design was hired to prepare drawings for the proposed move of the Community Compactors. He met with the Board on December 10th and presented drawings for the project. At the time of the meeting he was at 60 of completion for the design of the area. Prior to the meeting with the Board Tony met with Dingman Township personnel where drawings were reviewed and suggested revisions were discussed. He stated that town directed that Conashaugh will need to schedule a meeting with members regarding the proposed project. That meeting must address location of the project as well as plans for CLCA contiguous lots  lots owned by Conashaugh that are next to the proposed project area. Tony will be present at a membership meeting to address plansconcerns regarding the project. At the time of this article that meeting is scheduled to take place Sunday March 10th at 2:00 p.m. at the Rec Building. Members, regardless of whether you are for or opposed to this project should attend this meeting. Minutes will be taken and provided to the Dingman Township Supervisors for their review for zoning and permits. Reward Offered There is a 100.00 reward for information that results in the successful prosecution of the persons who is dumping bags of cat litter along Conashaugh Trail. If you owned a cat, would you toss bags of its dirty litter along our roads? It seems like a silly question but someone is doing that right here in our community. Bag after nasty bag of this stuff was recovered in the fall from along Conashaugh Trail beginning where it intersects Seneca, headed down towards 739. It couldnt be deciphered at the time if the deposits were a current occurrence or something from long ago; but then during a recent stroll along Conashaugh Trail, a new crop of these delights were discovered. Unfortunately the new collections are frozen to the ground making it impossible to pick up without subjecting ones self to a kitty litter and turd shower. How difficult is it to drive to the compactor? Its only open 7 days a week between 10 and 14 hours. Its a long shot but, if you happen to witness this deliberate and unacceptable activity, please contact the office 686-4000 or Security 686-1130. Thank you. Paying Your Dues by Check? Our bank has requested that we no longer accept checks unless the name Conashaugh Lakes Community Association is fully written on them as payee. Please do not abbreviate future checksCLCA. If you are using autobill pay through your bank account, please update payee information. Sorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your co-operation. Recycling Did you know that Dingman is a Mandated Municipality under the Pennsylvania Act 101 and subject to DEPs solid waste regulations? What that means is that all property owners within the municipality must have access to solid waste recycling. Private Communities received a reminder of the recycling mandate in December. Conashaugh implemented recycling in the summer of 2010. Ours is single stream recycling. Items need not be separated. As a reminder, plastic bags do not belong in the recycling bins. Please empty bags and place them in the trash receptacle for disposal. Styro-foam is also a non-recyclable item that requires deposit in the compactor. Our collection bins are for recyclables from members households. Members with businesses are not to use the bins for the purpose of recycling their business recyclables. Like business related trash, recycling is part of the cost of one owning a business and is not a cost that should be borne by your dues-paying neighbors. Anyone found using the recycling bins as their personal dumpsters will be fined. If you witness such activity, please alert the office of the date and time as soon as practical. Rewards are available to those providing information that leads to successful violations of our trash rules. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2019 PAGE 4 Conashaugh Has a New Website!

Annette Musano, Rec Liaison Phone Scam Alert Well it seems that some entrepreneur has figured a way to call homes in the community and make it appear that security is making the call. The caller is an aggressive, loud female trying to sell insurance. This might solve an ongoing mystery where people have called us at the office saying we have called their home multiple timesaccording to their caller id and we did not. Please note that if we need to reach you, we will leave a messageif you do not answer. Thank you. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2019 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION Seriously? You had this with you for over 1,200 miles but you just couldnt hold on to this for another mile, so out the window you threw it!!!!! I Am On A Journey BY VALERIE FERLAUTO Traveling the road to better health thru walking, as suggested to me by a medical professional, who I cannot thank enough for the suggestion. I have forced, against her will, a certain Ms. Jeanne, to join me on this healthy adventure. As we walk we chat, about our families, our friends and our lives. The first time we walked we noticed a HUGE amount of orphans, tired, neglected and scattered on both sides of the road. By orphans I mean sad things that have been left behind by people who no longer had a need for them and obviously didnt know the proper way of discarding their trash so they were left, on the sides of our beautiful streets. After our second walk, we made the decision to bring a bag and some good old fashioned Grandma Grabbers with us. We filled that first bag in less than fifteen minutes. The next day we took more bags with us and filled all of them. The bags were clumsy and heavy so we upgraded to using a cart that holds the bags for us, then went all out and added a second cart to our morning exercise. We were not the first to walk and collect trash on Conashaugh Trail. As a matter of fact, we know a certain young man also collects these orphans regularly along Conashaugh Trail, so, you can imagine my broken heart when we were able to fill three bags with these orphans, as well as a few things that were too big for bags! What I dont understand is the WHY?!? Why would anyone feel it is acceptable to throw these things onto our streets? What kind of a person would do this? Here are my thoughts on these people: This is a very small representation of one days haul! Although I am feeling healthier in my body, more energized from the exercise, my heart is heavy with the knowledge that so many people just dont give a hoot about their home, our community. Way too many bags filled with unimaginable things!!!! Looked like a lot of crap to me! Several of these found. Some contractor has been busy, busy, busy, besides littering, heshe has been spending a lot of time at Hemlock Farms! Here is a nice variety pack of all things bad for your body as well as our environment! Someones lunch? Seriously! No respect for your health or our beautiful community! Wipes? Wondering what anyone was wiping on Conashaugh Trail? So many health conscious people in our community! Found an endless amount of these...unfortunate fools, we also found the filters for hundreds of cigarettes...you with the pink lipstick, you need to quit smoking! Someone has a drinking problem!!!!! Check your neighbors breath please, let me know when you smell the scent of cinnamon, I have a collection of some 26 or more of these...I think it would be cheaper to buy the big bottle and just fill up one little bottle on an as needed basis! As well it would be more environmentally friendly, but then again, I guess you are drinking these little bad boys thinking your family wont know but that big bottle will give you away. AA meets at St. Vincents, give them a call, you need HELP! Save These Dates! The Rec Committee has proposed the following events for 2019:  Easter Picnic April 13th  CLCA Annual Picnic July 20th  Adult Pool Party Saturday July 27th CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2019 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION An Artisan Amongst Us CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 from the corporate world to the art world. Dawn continues to be recognized for her beautiful glass and metal jewelry art with her last award being in 2018 at the Delphi Art Glass Festival. She won First Place for a piece named Turquoise Surprise. Dawn finally left the corporate world behind. I know they miss her much more then she misses them! She made the big move to Conashaugh Lakes two years ago. Her home of so many years, Connecticut, is just a few hours away. She still goes back to teach a course in a studio she once was a student in. Although creating her art gives her the most pleasure, she loves to share her craft and teach it to others. She is planning on doing a demonstration here at Conashaugh Lakes Recreation Center. Participants will be creating their own piece of jewelry art during the demonstration. There will be a fee for the cost of materials. Her studio is not open to the public. I am one of the lucky people who have been invited into her studio to experience her artistic talents. When I first walked into her studio I was amazed by the neat and organized way she has set up the space. Her tools are simple: heat, fire, water, glass, metal and her artistic heart. Her results are pure art. My suggestion to you, come to the demonstration! Visit her website: www.dawnlombard.com, where you can view her First Place piece Turquois Surprise. Check her out on Facebook: DawnLombardArtist; email her, DawnDawnLombard.com. Some of our local stores that sell her art: Foundry42 in Port Jervis, New York and Golden Fish Gallery, Milford, Pennsylvania.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2019 PAGE 7 CLC ASSOCIATION Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are in our future. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, others may not be as familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVW gross vehicle weight of Have you heard about The Pennsylvania Yellow Dot Program? It was created to help Pennsylvania Citizens to provide important information to emergency personnel in the event of an accident where they are left unable to communicate. Having a yellow dot decal in your rear vehicle window alerts Pennsylvania responders that the vehicle glove box contains emergency information. Yellow Dot kits are now available at the CLCA Office. The pamphlets include medical and emergency contact information forms and a yellow dot decal. For additional information on this program, please visit https:www.paturnpike.comtravelyellowdot.aspx Thank you! PA Yellow Dot Thank you to member Lois Tanous for submitting this tranquil picture Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP, our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.com conashaughlakes and website, www.conashaughlakes.com. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many, if not all, delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they didnt know. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility companies and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation.

Most of us are inspired by the beauty of The Pocono Mountains and the serene life in Conashaugh Lakes. Others, like Dawn Lombard, have plotted and planned their exodus from traffic, high taxes and noise. For Dawn, it had a lot to do with all of the above, however, she was also attracted to Pike County due to its proximity to several Artisan venues. Peters Valley School of Craft in Layton, New Jersey and Pike County Arts and Crafts in Milford, Pennsylvania, just to name two that played a role in her choice of location. When she was in high school she found that she was challenged to complete her yearend art project. This final project of an ocean view had to be helped along by her mother. Although she felt that she didnt have any artistic talent, as a college student she majored in Studio Art. She thought there was beauty in taking raw materials and creating art. She eventually changed her major to business and then received her MBA in International Marketing. Her artistic side remained dormant while she worked in the corporate world for almost twenty five years. Dawn spent a lot of time feeling the stress that many people experience with the demands of their job. When her sister approached her in 2002 to take a glass bead course she jumped at the opportunity. The minute she put the torch to glass she knew that she found her escape from corporate life. The class she took was in Lampworking which is an old art form which is believed to have its roots in Italy. It is called Lampworking because, originally these glass pieces were made using a lamp to melt and shape the glass. Within the last twenty years there has been a resurgence of artists like Dawn, who are bringing the beauty of Lampworking back to life. She began to realize that she was going thru the motions at work but really wanted to spend her time creating art. She couldnt wait to get home from work so she could spend some quiet time developing her skills in Lampworking. In 2004 she was able to set up a home studio. She would spend her nights and weekends creating art and business days working in the corporate world dreaming about her studio art. 2006 was the turning point in her artistry. She was producing work that was being shown in nationally acclaimed juried shows. In 2015 with a few awards to her name, she transitioned An Artisan Amongst Us BY VALERIE FERLAUTO",

Important Reminders Regarding Snow  Other Weather Events Snow Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. This is especially important during snow events as doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of damage to your vehicle. We are aware that the slope of some driveways makes it very difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. If you need to park at the end of your driveway, please keep vehicles back a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road. Remove all basketball hoops and other sport equipment from the roads. Shoveling and plowing snow onto roads from driveways and cleaning snow off vehicles in the road creates hazardous conditions and Safety Violations subject to fines. All property owners using private contractors to remove snow are responsible for alerting them of this regulation. Keep kids and pets safe. Please do not allow them to play on or near snow banks along the roads or in the bus parking lot. Severe weather may result in the closure of compactors. Power Outages During a power outage all of the entry and exit gates go into the up position. The gates have back up batteries that allow for this to happen instead of staying in the down position. Gates cannot be manually lifted or operated without power. Once power is restored the gates will return to the down position. The compactors cannot operate without power therefore they will be closed. Please hold trash until the power is restored and the compactors can be reopened. Do not leave trash outside the gate or throw it in the recycle bins.",

He met with the Board on December 10th and presented drawings for the project. At the time of the meeting he was at 60 of completion for the design of the area. Prior to the meeting with the Board Tony met with Dingman Township personnel where drawings were reviewed and suggested revisions were discussed. He stated that town directed that Conashaugh will need to schedule a meeting with members regarding the proposed project. That meeting must address location of the project as well as plans for CLCA contiguous lots  lots owned by Conashaugh that are next to the proposed project area. Tony will be present at a membership meeting to address plansconcerns regarding the project. At the time of this article that meeting is scheduled to take place Sunday March 10th at 2:00 p.m. at the Rec Building. Members, regardless of whether you are for or opposed to this project should attend this meeting. Minutes will be taken and provided to the Dingman Township Supervisors for their review for zoning and permits. Reward Offered There is a 100.00 reward for information that results in the successful prosecution of the persons who is dumping bags of cat litter along Conashaugh Trail. If you owned a cat, would you toss bags of its dirty litter along our roads? It seems like a silly question but someone is doing that right here in our community. Bag after nasty bag of this stuff was recovered in the fall from along Conashaugh Trail beginning where it intersects Seneca, headed down towards 739. It couldnt be deciphered at the time if the deposits were a current occurrence or something from long ago; but then during a recent stroll along Conashaugh Trail, a new crop of these delights were discovered. Unfortunately the new collections are frozen to the ground making it impossible to pick up without subjecting ones self to a kitty litter and turd shower. How difficult is it to drive to the compactor? Its only open 7 days a week between 10 and 14 hours. Its a long shot but, if you happen to witness this deliberate and unacceptable activity, please contact the office 686-4000 or Security 686-1130. Thank you. Paying Your Dues by Check? Our bank has requested that we no longer accept checks unless the name Conashaugh Lakes Community Association is fully written on them as payee. Please do not abbreviate future checksCLCA. If you are using autobill pay through your bank account, please update payee information. Sorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your co-operation. Recycling Did you know that Dingman is a Mandated Municipality under the Pennsylvania Act 101 and subject to DEPs solid waste regulations? What that means is that all property owners within the municipality must have access to solid waste recycling. Private Communities received a reminder of the recycling mandate in December. Conashaugh implemented recycling in the summer of 2010. Ours is single stream recycling. Items need not be separated. As a reminder, plastic bags do not belong in the recycling bins. Please empty bags and place them in the trash receptacle for disposal. Styro-foam is also a non-recyclable item that requires deposit in the compactor. Our collection bins are for recyclables from members households. Members with businesses are not to use the bins for the purpose of recycling their business recyclables. Like business related trash, recycling is part of the cost of one owning a business and is not a cost that should be borne by your dues-paying neighbors. Anyone found using the recycling bins as their personal dumpsters will be fined. If you witness such activity, please alert the office of the date and time as soon as practical. Rewards are available to those providing information that leads to successful violations of our trash rules.",

The caller is an aggressive, loud female trying to sell insurance.

You had this with you for over 1,200 miles but you just couldnt hold on to this for another mile, so out the window you threw it!!!!! I Am On A Journey BY VALERIE FERLAUTO Traveling the road to better health thru walking, as suggested to me by a medical professional, who I cannot thank enough for the suggestion. I have forced, against her will, a certain Ms. Jeanne, to join me on this healthy adventure. As we walk we chat, about our families, our friends and our lives. The first time we walked we noticed a HUGE amount of orphans, tired, neglected and scattered on both sides of the road. By orphans I mean sad things that have been left behind by people who no longer had a need for them and obviously didnt know the proper way of discarding their trash so they were left, on the sides of our beautiful streets. After our second walk, we made the decision to bring a bag and some good old fashioned Grandma Grabbers with us. We filled that first bag in less than fifteen minutes. The next day we took more bags with us and filled all of them. The bags were clumsy and heavy so we upgraded to using a cart that holds the bags for us, then went all out and added a second cart to our morning exercise. We were not the first to walk and collect trash on Conashaugh Trail. As a matter of fact, we know a certain young man also collects these orphans regularly along Conashaugh Trail, so, you can imagine my broken heart when we were able to fill three bags with these orphans, as well as a few things that were too big for bags! What I dont understand is the WHY?!? Why would anyone feel it is acceptable to throw these things onto our streets? What kind of a person would do this? Here are my thoughts on these people: This is a very small representation of one days haul! Although I am feeling healthier in my body, more energized from the exercise, my heart is heavy with the knowledge that so many people just dont give a hoot about their home, our community. Way too many bags filled with unimaginable things!!!! Looked like a lot of crap to me! Several of these found. Some contractor has been busy, busy, busy, besides littering, heshe has been spending a lot of time at Hemlock Farms! Here is a nice variety pack of all things bad for your body as well as our environment! Someones lunch? Seriously! No respect for your health or our beautiful community! Wipes? Wondering what anyone was wiping on Conashaugh Trail? So many health conscious people in our community! Found an endless amount of these...unfortunate fools, we also found the filters for hundreds of cigarettes...you with the pink lipstick, you need to quit smoking! Someone has a drinking problem!!!!! Check your neighbors breath please, let me know when you smell the scent of cinnamon, I have a collection of some 26 or more of these...I think it would be cheaper to buy the big bottle and just fill up one little bottle on an as needed basis! As well it would be more environmentally friendly, but then again, I guess you are drinking these little bad boys thinking your family wont know but that big bottle will give you away. AA meets at St. Vincents, give them a call, you need HELP! Save These Dates! The Rec Committee has proposed the following events for 2019:  Easter Picnic April 13th  CLCA Annual Picnic July 20th  Adult Pool Party Saturday July 27th",

Dawn continues to be recognized for her beautiful glass and metal jewelry art with her last award being in 2018 at the Delphi Art Glass Festival. She won First Place for a piece named Turquoise Surprise. Dawn finally left the corporate world behind. I know they miss her much more then she misses them! She made the big move to Conashaugh Lakes two years ago. Her home of so many years, Connecticut, is just a few hours away. She still goes back to teach a course in a studio she once was a student in. Although creating her art gives her the most pleasure, she loves to share her craft and teach it to others. She is planning on doing a demonstration here at Conashaugh Lakes Recreation Center. Participants will be creating their own piece of jewelry art during the demonstration. There will be a fee for the cost of materials. Her studio is not open to the public. I am one of the lucky people who have been invited into her studio to experience her artistic talents. When I first walked into her studio I was amazed by the neat and organized way she has set up the space. Her tools are simple: heat, fire, water, glass, metal and her artistic heart. Her results are pure art. My suggestion to you, come to the demonstration! Visit her website: www.dawnlombard.com, where you can view her First Place piece Turquois Surprise. Check her out on Facebook: DawnLombardArtist; email her, DawnDawnLombard.com.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2019 PAGE 7 CLC ASSOCIATION Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are in our future. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, others may not be as familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. These seasonal restrictions were enacted to minimize the impact to roads by heavy vehicles. Some local roads outside the Community have road bans that run between specific months each year during the late winter and early spring. The posted bans limit the weight of vehicles traveling on those roads and vary by location. We too have road bans within the Community and want to make sure that all of our members are aware of that fact. Unlike roadways outside the Community, our bans do not run for a three month window. We are permitted by law, a total of eight weeks for a road ban during which time vehicles with a GVW gross vehicle weight of Have you heard about The Pennsylvania Yellow Dot Program? It was created to help Pennsylvania Citizens to provide important information to emergency personnel in the event of an accident where they are left unable to communicate. Having a yellow dot decal in your rear vehicle window alerts Pennsylvania responders that the vehicle glove box contains emergency information. Yellow Dot kits are now available at the CLCA Office. The pamphlets include medical and emergency contact information forms and a yellow dot decal. For additional information on this program, please visit https:www.paturnpike.comtravelyellowdot.aspx Thank you! PA Yellow Dot Thank you to member Lois Tanous for submitting this tranquil picture Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read 10,000 pounds or greater are not permitted to enter the Community. The bans may run eight weeks consecutively or separately and are based on weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. When the time approaches for a road ban, maintenance personnel will inspect conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP, our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.com conashaughlakes and website, www.conashaughlakes.com. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many, if not all, delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they didnt know. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility companies and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation.",

HAVE A PEST PROBLEM? PESTS IN SEASON CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2020 PAGE 3 CLC ASSOCIATION Welcome to the Annual Summer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. Please note that due to the impact of COVID to advertisers this issue will be a little light. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20202021 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September, which this year falls on September 26th. Due to capacity restrictions resulting from COVID, the meeting will take place outdoors at the CLCA picnic area at Seneca Lake. Tents will be set up. To ensure adequate seating, members who plan to attend the meeting are asked to send an RSVP to administrator conashaughlakes.com. Members are asked to wear a mask for check in and to maintain safe distancing from others. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Unfortunately again due to COVID refreshments will not be served. Elsewhere in this publication you will find the 20202021 Proposed Budget and a Board of Director Candidate bio. While the proposed 20202021 Budget includes a zero percent increase, which may make you happy, your vote is still very important. Without the memberships participation and a quorum minimum of 10 response there is technically no vote. No vote means no budget and with no budget we cannot operate. So please be sure to vote. All members will receive a ballot in the mail. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together 570.296.9200 CALL NOW! New Homes, Remodeling  LotHouse Packages WWW.EDNIKLES.COM HIC 006369 1963 B u i l d i n g H o m e s a n d R e l a t i o n s h i p s since September 26th 2020 Save the Date! CLCA Annual Meeting own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts accounts with delinquent dues or other non-paid balances are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you are planning to attend the Annual Meeting you can still mail in your ballot. This way if something comes up and you are unable to attend the meeting at least your vote makes it to the count. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding the items to be voted. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office. To Advertise Call 845-456-1218 CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2020 PAGE 4 Taking a Look at Dues History Each year CLCA members are asked to vote on proposed dues for the upcoming year. The proposed budget is prepared annually by the Finance Committee and presented to the Board for review. Once it is approved by the Board it is then presented to the membership for its review and vote. There was some debate heard through the grapevine regarding how dues are determined each year. Some inquired as to how dues are prepared, others believe that money is automatically added to the previous year while others predict dues reaching sky high into the thousands of dollars within a short few years. As reported in this issue of the Courier, the proposed 20202021 CLCA budget contains a zero increase from last years dues. Below is a fourteen year history of CLCA dues: School is Open Please Drive Carefully From all appearances, Monday August 31st will be the first day of school. At this point COVID will be playing a role in school operations and protocol. Below are some reminders for the CLCA Bus stop. While we have not been officially notified, bus capacities and bus stop rules will likely be impacted. Changes andor additional announcements will be made on our official Facebook page and flyer handouts. If you are having caregivers, grandparents or others picking up or dropping off your children, please be sure to make them aware of all procedures.

Please note that in the afternoon small buses will be dropping off their passengers in the mailbox lot. The area to the right side of the lot as you are approaching the mailbox area exit is reserved for parking for those buses and people picking up students who are on them. Others are asked not to park in this area. In the event that you are running late for a pick-up in the afternoon, let your child know that they are welcome to wait on the office deck until a ride arrives. There are quite a few new families in our community and others new to the bus stop experience. Please be courteous and helpful to others.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2020 PAGE 5 CLCA ELECTIONS Thomas Famoso Hello to Conashaugh Lakes Residents: My name is Thomas Famoso. My wife and I have lived in Conashaugh for almost nineteen years during which time I have actively served on the Strategic Planning Committee and the Security Committee. I have been appointed to temporarily fill a vacancy on the Board as liaison to the Environmental Committee. Now a little about my past experience. I have retired from the U.S. Army at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel as well as from the NY City Fire Department FirefighterFire Marshal. I am presently a part-time substitute teacher in our local area schools as I have been since my days back at the New York City Department of Education. I look forward to having the privilege of serving this great community while ensuring a safe, respectful environment with honest and ethical principles. See you at the meeting. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2020 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION No Off-Road Vehicles Permitted on CLCA roads The operation of motorized vehicles, gas or electric that are not registered for public road use is prohibited on Conashaugh Lakes roads and common areas. This includes but is not limited to ATVs, UTVs, dirt bikes, go-karts, electric bicycles, scooters etc. Non-Licensed Operation of Motor Vehicles Persons who are driving vehicles on our roads must possess a valid drivers license. Those driving with a drivers permit may only operate a vehicle while accompanied by a person with a valid drivers license. Do not allow your permitted child to just drive to their friends homes, the bus stop or anywhere else in this Community. If you have had your drivers license suspended, you are not a licensed driver. Unlicensed drivers are subject to fines. Parentsguardians who allow their unlicensed children are also subject to a fine for allowing an unlicensed driver accessuse of your vehicle. Requests for vehicle Documents There has been some debate regarding Securitys right to ask drivers to produce vehicle documents such as an insurance card and registration. If you are pulled over by Security, you are required to produce these documents along with a valid drivers license when asked. If you do not, you will be cited for each document not produced. If you receive a citation You will have 30 days to respond. You are entitled to Due Process. If you wish to contest the citations you will need to send your written or emailed request to adminassistantconashaughlakes.com. A hearing date will be arranged with the Hearing Committee and you will be notified. If a hearing is scheduled and you do not show up, the hearing will proceed without you. Please do not call or visit the office to object to a citation or being pulled over. If you have a concern regarding an interaction with an officer, please put that concern in writing and send it to the office. Citations issued for not producing valid documents license, registration or insurance may be dismissed by providing a photo of the valid documents to the office within the above mentioned time frame. If you do not wish to contest a citation, you can pay it. Please make payments to Conashaugh Lakes Community Association. Please be sure to reference the citation with payments or documentation. Burning Within the Community All residents wishing to use burn barrels or campfire pits need to contact the office for a permit. It is a free, one-time process. The permit includes procedures to follow to ensure safety. It is important to call Pike County Communications 570296-7700 each time you burn. This is required by Dingman Township. You also need to call Security 570 686-1130. When calling Security, you do not have to speak to a live person. Please leave a message that you are burning which includes your name, time, lot number and 911 address. Calling the Com Center is important because it is a requirement of our township. By doing so you are helping prevent the possibility of a false alarm being responded to in the event that someone sees the fire and believes it to not be a controlled situation and calling 911. Our Township Fire Department consists of volunteers who are stretched thin enough without having to be called to a campfire. When burning please be considerate of your neighbors. There are many homes with open windows or people outside enjoying their own backyards. Never burn garbage, furniture, building materials or caustic materials. Use a burn barrel or closed campfire ring. Be cognizant that what you burn into and leave on the ground has a good chance to one day end up in your well. There is no burning of tree stumps and brush without written permission of Conashaugh Lakes. Keep a hose at the site. Most importantly be aware of conditions before you burn and obey all burn bans that may be in effect. You can find out about burn bans by visiting the Dingman Township Fire Department website at http:www.dingmanfire.comBurning20Ban.htm. By following these simple steps you can enjoy your fire while ensuring safety to your neighbors as well first responders by not having to be called out to a friendly fire. Rules of the Road Reminders: It is interesting to note that some feel they do not have to answer to Security. For example the occasional challenge for lack of a better term, to being pulled over for speeding or running a stop sign. Yes, Security does have the right to pull you over if you committed a violation. Thats part of their job. While Conashaugh is a private Community and our roads are private that doesnt mean its open season and folks can drive however they wish to drive. That is no ones right. Speed limits and stop signs are not optional. The same rules of the road apply in Conashaugh as when one is driving outside of the Community. If a member is not in agreement with receiving a citation for a violation then they are free to contest it. Thats everyones right in every case.

Join me in Why There Are Trash Restrictions Please note that the compactors are for household trash only. This is a house rule, not one imposed by our hauler. What is household trash? The list is long, so lets start by saying what isnt household trash? There are signs on the compactor doors regarding items not allowed in the compactor including but not limited to construction debris, yard waste, electronics and hazardous materials. While the prohibition of electronics and hazardous waste are for environmental reasons the other items are for cost control for our members. It should not be the responsibility for the membership at large to share in the cost of anyones home construction, house clean outs by people moving in or out, business operations or other projects that generate more than household trash. Considering there are 568 homes in the community, allowing that type of trash in the compactors could add greatly to our expenses. This is why we hold dumpster day twice per year for a charge or request members to rent dumpsters. In addition to our in-house dumpster day events, township collections are advertised. While compactor units are owned by Conashaugh, the cans are owned by our provider County Waste. Each can holds 10 ten tons. We are charged 325.00 for each time the cans are pulled plus 69.50 per ton for contents. On average cans are removed 3 times per month. Dumpster day usually reaps 3, sometimes 4 large dumpsters of trash. This past dumpster day reaped so much trash that an additional 3 dumpsters were needed in addition to 4 that we had on site to be brought in to remove it. During dumpster day the dumpsters are compacted using a back hoe to ensure that as much trash as possible is in the dumpsters. Recycling has helped keep our costs for trash under control since 2010. There are concerns regarding the future of recycling. Costs have increased due to reduced resources to accept process recycling. At the onset of the COVID stay at home order a major abuse of our trash amenity occurred. While it is understandable that being locked in the house presented opportunities to clean house, it went beyond that. Members allowing their family and friends who do not live here access to our trash amenity, members throwing out items that were clearly in violation of our trash and environmental rules occurred despite repeated requests not to dispose of such items. The stay at home order started around mid-March 2020. A comparison of trash volume from March and April 2019 revealed 85 tons of trash was hauled. That is an increase of approximately 20 tons more deposited trash for the same period one year ago. In an effort to better control who is using this amenity and what goes in the compactors, usage hours were reduced and the area is now manned. This is something that was previously announced to happen with the new compactor area but expedited due to abuse. Following the hours being changed and area manned, the amount of trash for May and June dropped to 68 tons which is 17 tons less than before the changes occurred. It is also in line with a comparison from last year at the same time. Although postponed due to COVID we were thankfully able to hold dumpster day in May. As mentioned the cost for dumpster day is not shared by the Community. It is paid by the people who participate. There are multiple resources and events in the area outside of the Community to dispose of items not permitted in the Compactors. If you have a home improvement project or major clean out of your home, garage or property, rent a dumpster. Waste Management also has a transfer station in Beach Lake, Pa.

Included in that packet are the 20202021 Proposed Budget, CLCA Reserve schedule, Board Candidate info and a ballot proxy. The proposed budget is for a ZERO increase for a second year in a row. This was accomplished despite unanticipated COVID related expenses and other unanticipated expenses including but not limited to a major repairs to pool plumbing and the basketball tennis court surfaces. Another major factor enabling this result and much thanks for it, goes to our members who continued to pay their dues during this difficult time. Budget and Reserves 101 CLC ASSOCIATION The Finance Committee would like our Members to have an understanding of our Budget and Reserve Schedules. The following is in an effort to walk you through these two documents and the differences between them. The Budget is for the day to day operation of the community think of it as checkbook for dailymonthly operating expenses and the Reserve schedule is for replacement of large assets such as major building repairs or renovations, trucks and larger equipment replacement think of it as a savings account. Budget: For those of you who may not know this, unlike a number of communities in the area, our members vote on the budget. The CLCA budget is worked on by the Finance Committee. As with all of our Committees, any member in good standing is welcome to attend the meetings. Work on the budget typically begins in June. Averages of actual expenses for the past four years are the starting point to working on the budget. Additional consideration for projected increases or decreases in costs are also looked at and adjusted accordingly. There are two parts to the budget Inflows money in and General Operating expensesmoney out. The totals for each of those sections must be the same. That is a balanced budget. There are lines for inflows including dues. It is important to not confuse Inflows incomemoney in with General Operating Expenses money out. Income: The primary source of income is dues. If you look at the bottom right side of the page for the proposed 20202021 Budget you will note the number of homes, lots and contiguous lots. If you take the number from the Homeowners dues inflow line 695,887.00 and divide it by the number of homes 569 your answer is 1223.00 proposed dues for homes the same math applies for lots and contiguous lots. Dues discount is a projected amount of money that will reduce dues income as a result of members taking advantage of this payment option. The doubtful account line is the projected amount of money we will not receive from members who fail to pay their dues. This could be for a number of reasons valid and non-valid including but not limited to, foreclosure, bankruptcy, hardship, lack of priorities, abandonment of lots to foreclosure and tax sales. Effort is made whenever legally possible to pursue unpaid dues by the office staff, our attorney and through the legal system. Other Inflowsincome are estimated based on history and projection. Income from resale certificates and transfer fees can fluctuate depending on the home market. Expenses There are three different payroll expense lines, one for the office, one for maintenance and the third payroll is included in the pool supplies and operations. Payroll bonus applies to all permanent employees. Currently there are 8. There are two lines for the Dam. There are two road lines. One is for repair of the roads which can include materials such as stone, culvert pipes, wood for guide rails, signage etc. In addition to the road repair line there is a road reserve line. In the past those funds were utilized to pave dirt roads. Future funds to this account will include major repairs to maintain the roads. Miscellaneous expense can cover a number of expenses. Donations to the Fire Department, Humane Society or additional educational expenses for staff that may be needed and are over and above training budget. Reserves On the reverse side of the Budget is the General Reserve schedule. This lists CLCAs larger owned assets. Nothing lasts forever and will eventually need to be repaired, roofed, sided, windows, septic, well pumps, restored or totally replaced or expanded. These funds are for that purpose. While we have these items insured, maintenance, deterioration and wear and tear are not covered by insurance. Thanks to reserves, Conashaugh is free of loans and interest payments for those loans. Reserves have also deterred the need to charge members for long term additional assessments. Not too many HOAs can say that. The list is reviewed and items no longer owned and or replaced are removed or updated. Funds for removed items that are no longer needed are redistributed to underfunded lines. It should also be noted that the schedule of listed assets are periodically reviewed and the replacement cost may need to be adjusted up or down. As for the reserve schedule, the first column after the asset description is the original cost for that item. The amounts funded for certain items were questioned in the past. The funded amounts for the individual line items are not set in stone. In other words, if needed or decided those funds can be moved to another item. An example of what is being said here is as follows: Say that a vehicle or piece of equipment failed beyond repair and replacement was necessary. The replacement cost for that item by either or new or used item is 10,000 but the reserve line for that item was only funded for 5,000.00. The additional 5,000.00 could be moved from another item or items to make up the difference to enable the replacement. Hopefully the above will clarify some of the information concerning the proposed budget and reserve schedule. If you have any questions, please contact the office. Although there is a zero proposed increase, it is very important for the Membership to vote. We must have a budget to operate and a quorum at least 10 of the membership for the vote. If you have not received your Annual Meeting packet, please contact the office. Thank you CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2020 PAGE 11 CONASHAUGH Letters Who You Gonna Call?

Although we are a private Community we are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. They have full access to the Community and do come in to enforce rules including but not limited to possession of fishing licenses and boat safety equipment. Be aware of life jacket and safety equipment that is required when on the water. All children 12 years of age and younger on all Commonwealth waters must wear a life jacket while underway on any boat 20 feet in length or less and on all canoes and kayaks. Underway includes drifting boats. For boating and fishing rules please visit: https:www.fishandboat.comPagesdefault.aspx Dont be fooled by a warm beautiful day, especially in the spring and fall. Water temps are still frigid. Cold water can kill quickly. You can be a great swimmer but you cannot swim when overcome by hypothermia. Life jackets are required to be worn by all between November 1 through April 30th when on a boat 16 feet or less and all canoes and kayaks. Although we are not in ice season, it will come soon enough.

Please note that due to the impact of COVID to advertisers this issue will be a little light. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20202021 and Board Candidates. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September, which this year falls on September 26th. Due to capacity restrictions resulting from COVID, the meeting will take place outdoors at the CLCA picnic area at Seneca Lake. Tents will be set up. To ensure adequate seating, members who plan to attend the meeting are asked to send an RSVP to administrator conashaughlakes.com. Members are asked to wear a mask for check in and to maintain safe distancing from others. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Unfortunately again due to COVID refreshments will not be served. Elsewhere in this publication you will find the 20202021 Proposed Budget and a Board of Director Candidate bio. While the proposed 20202021 Budget includes a zero percent increase, which may make you happy, your vote is still very important. Without the memberships participation and a quorum minimum of 10 response there is technically no vote. No vote means no budget and with no budget we cannot operate. So please be sure to vote. All members will receive a ballot in the mail. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together 570.296.9200 CALL NOW!

CLCA Annual Meeting own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to our Accountants Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts accounts with delinquent dues or other non-paid balances are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you are planning to attend the Annual Meeting you can still mail in your ballot. This way if something comes up and you are unable to attend the meeting at least your vote makes it to the count. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding the items to be voted. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office. To Advertise Call 845-456-1218",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2020 PAGE 4 Taking a Look at Dues History Each year CLCA members are asked to vote on proposed dues for the upcoming year. The proposed budget is prepared annually by the Finance Committee and presented to the Board for review. Once it is approved by the Board it is then presented to the membership for its review and vote. There was some debate heard through the grapevine regarding how dues are determined each year. Some inquired as to how dues are prepared, others believe that money is automatically added to the previous year while others predict dues reaching sky high into the thousands of dollars within a short few years. As reported in this issue of the Courier, the proposed 20202021 CLCA budget contains a zero increase from last years dues. Below is a fourteen year history of CLCA dues: School is Open Please Drive Carefully From all appearances, Monday August 31st will be the first day of school. At this point COVID will be playing a role in school operations and protocol. Below are some reminders for the CLCA Bus stop. While we have not been officially notified, bus capacities and bus stop rules will likely be impacted. Changes andor additional announcements will be made on our official Facebook page and flyer handouts. If you are having caregivers, grandparents or others picking up or dropping off your children, please be sure to make them aware of all procedures. Parents guardians are responsible for ensuring that children are aware of and complying with social distancing or other requirements.  Please allow ample time to travel to the bus stop and arrive at least 5 minutes before your childs bus time  Follow all travel direction signs in the lotlanes are ONE WAY  Speed limit in the parking lot is 5mph  Park in one space  Do not park in aisles  Do not attempt to stop buses once they have begun moving  Do not exit via the bus gate, please use proper exit  Do not discharge or pick up students in the main entrance area Morning riders need to stay on the propersafe side of the bus depot and wait until the bus enters and comes to a complete stop before crossing to the area to enter the busthere is a sign.

Do not allow non-licensed student drivers to drive to the bus stop without being accompanied by a licensed driver. Elementary students should be accompanied by parentsguardians to their buses. Do not allow children to run unaccompanied through the parking lot or tofrom the mailbox area. If you are having someone who does not live in the community picking up or dropping off your children, please arrange for the office to permit them access through the gate by calling with their information. Pick ups in the entrance are not allowed. The parking lot procedures for afternoon pick up for elementary school buses are still in effect. All vehicles must be parked and not moving when buses for the elementaryprimary school are present in the afternoon. Do not proceed to leave the parking lot until directed to so by Security. If there is not enough parking in the school bus lot, parking in the mailbox area is permitted, however, do not block mailbox parking lot aisles or park in the area reserved for small buses. Please note that in the afternoon small buses will be dropping off their passengers in the mailbox lot. The area to the right side of the lot as you are approaching the mailbox area exit is reserved for parking for those buses and people picking up students who are on them. Others are asked not to park in this area. In the event that you are running late for a pick-up in the afternoon, let your child know that they are welcome to wait on the office deck until a ride arrives. There are quite a few new families in our community and others new to the bus stop experience. Please be courteous and helpful to others.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2020 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION No Off-Road Vehicles Permitted on CLCA roads The operation of motorized vehicles, gas or electric that are not registered for public road use is prohibited on Conashaugh Lakes roads and common areas. This includes but is not limited to ATVs, UTVs, dirt bikes, go-karts, electric bicycles, scooters etc. Non-Licensed Operation of Motor Vehicles Persons who are driving vehicles on our roads must possess a valid drivers license. Those driving with a drivers permit may only operate a vehicle while accompanied by a person with a valid drivers license. Do not allow your permitted child to just drive to their friends homes, the bus stop or anywhere else in this Community. If you have had your drivers license suspended, you are not a licensed driver. Unlicensed drivers are subject to fines. Parentsguardians who allow their unlicensed children are also subject to a fine for allowing an unlicensed driver accessuse of your vehicle. Requests for vehicle Documents There has been some debate regarding Securitys right to ask drivers to produce vehicle documents such as an insurance card and registration. If you are pulled over by Security, you are required to produce these documents along with a valid drivers license when asked. If you do not, you will be cited for each document not produced. If you receive a citation You will have 30 days to respond. You are entitled to Due Process. If you wish to contest the citations you will need to send your written or emailed request to adminassistantconashaughlakes.com. A hearing date will be arranged with the Hearing Committee and you will be notified. If a hearing is scheduled and you do not show up, the hearing will proceed without you. Please do not call or visit the office to object to a citation or being pulled over. If you have a concern regarding an interaction with an officer, please put that concern in writing and send it to the office. Citations issued for not producing valid documents license, registration or insurance may be dismissed by providing a photo of the valid documents to the office within the above mentioned time frame. If you do not wish to contest a citation, you can pay it. Please make payments to Conashaugh Lakes Community Association. Please be sure to reference the citation with payments or documentation. Burning Within the Community All residents wishing to use burn barrels or campfire pits need to contact the office for a permit. It is a free, one-time process. The permit includes procedures to follow to ensure safety. It is important to call Pike County Communications 570296-7700 each time you burn. This is required by Dingman Township. You also need to call Security 570 686-1130. When calling Security, you do not have to speak to a live person. Please leave a message that you are burning which includes your name, time, lot number and 911 address. Calling the Com Center is important because it is a requirement of our township. By doing so you are helping prevent the possibility of a false alarm being responded to in the event that someone sees the fire and believes it to not be a controlled situation and calling 911. Our Township Fire Department consists of volunteers who are stretched thin enough without having to be called to a campfire. When burning please be considerate of your neighbors. There are many homes with open windows or people outside enjoying their own backyards. Never burn garbage, furniture, building materials or caustic materials. Use a burn barrel or closed campfire ring. Be cognizant that what you burn into and leave on the ground has a good chance to one day end up in your well. There is no burning of tree stumps and brush without written permission of Conashaugh Lakes. Keep a hose at the site. Most importantly be aware of conditions before you burn and obey all burn bans that may be in effect. You can find out about burn bans by visiting the Dingman Township Fire Department website at http:www.dingmanfire.comBurning20Ban.htm. By following these simple steps you can enjoy your fire while ensuring safety to your neighbors as well first responders by not having to be called out to a friendly fire. Rules of the Road Reminders: It is interesting to note that some feel they do not have to answer to Security. For example the occasional challenge for lack of a better term, to being pulled over for speeding or running a stop sign. Yes, Security does have the right to pull you over if you committed a violation. Thats part of their job. While Conashaugh is a private Community and our roads are private that doesnt mean its open season and folks can drive however they wish to drive. That is no ones right. Speed limits and stop signs are not optional. The same rules of the road apply in Conashaugh as when one is driving outside of the Community. If a member is not in agreement with receiving a citation for a violation then they are free to contest it. Thats everyones right in every case. Contested violations are referred to the Hearing Committee, a group of volunteers who are not members of nor affiliated with the Board of Directors.

We put members first. Get in touch today. boulandnationwide.com 570257-0330 Vogel and Moore Inc Matthew  Debbie Boulanger Lords Valley. Join me in Why There Are Trash Restrictions Please note that the compactors are for household trash only. This is a house rule, not one imposed by our hauler. What is household trash? The list is long, so lets start by saying what isnt household trash? There are signs on the compactor doors regarding items not allowed in the compactor including but not limited to construction debris, yard waste, electronics and hazardous materials. While the prohibition of electronics and hazardous waste are for environmental reasons the other items are for cost control for our members. It should not be the responsibility for the membership at large to share in the cost of anyones home construction, house clean outs by people moving in or out, business operations or other projects that generate more than household trash. Considering there are 568 homes in the community, allowing that type of trash in the compactors could add greatly to our expenses. This is why we hold dumpster day twice per year for a charge or request members to rent dumpsters. In addition to our in-house dumpster day events, township collections are advertised. While compactor units are owned by Conashaugh, the cans are owned by our provider County Waste. Each can holds 10 ten tons. We are charged 325.00 for each time the cans are pulled plus 69.50 per ton for contents. On average cans are removed 3 times per month. Dumpster day usually reaps 3, sometimes 4 large dumpsters of trash. This past dumpster day reaped so much trash that an additional 3 dumpsters were needed in addition to 4 that we had on site to be brought in to remove it. During dumpster day the dumpsters are compacted using a back hoe to ensure that as much trash as possible is in the dumpsters. Recycling has helped keep our costs for trash under control since 2010. There are concerns regarding the future of recycling. Costs have increased due to reduced resources to accept process recycling. At the onset of the COVID stay at home order a major abuse of our trash amenity occurred. While it is understandable that being locked in the house presented opportunities to clean house, it went beyond that. Members allowing their family and friends who do not live here access to our trash amenity, members throwing out items that were clearly in violation of our trash and environmental rules occurred despite repeated requests not to dispose of such items. The stay at home order started around mid-March 2020. A comparison of trash volume from March and April 2019 revealed 85 tons of trash was hauled. That is an increase of approximately 20 tons more deposited trash for the same period one year ago. In an effort to better control who is using this amenity and what goes in the compactors, usage hours were reduced and the area is now manned. This is something that was previously announced to happen with the new compactor area but expedited due to abuse. Following the hours being changed and area manned, the amount of trash for May and June dropped to 68 tons which is 17 tons less than before the changes occurred. It is also in line with a comparison from last year at the same time. Although postponed due to COVID we were thankfully able to hold dumpster day in May. As mentioned the cost for dumpster day is not shared by the Community. It is paid by the people who participate. There are multiple resources and events in the area outside of the Community to dispose of items not permitted in the Compactors. If you have a home improvement project or major clean out of your home, garage or property, rent a dumpster. Waste Management also has a transfer station in Beach Lake, Pa.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2020 PAGE 10 All members should have received a packet in the mail that contains information regarding the CLCA Annual Meeting which will take place Saturday September 26th, 2020. Included in that packet are the 20202021 Proposed Budget, CLCA Reserve schedule, Board Candidate info and a ballot proxy. The proposed budget is for a ZERO increase for a second year in a row. This was accomplished despite unanticipated COVID related expenses and other unanticipated expenses including but not limited to a major repairs to pool plumbing and the basketball tennis court surfaces. Another major factor enabling this result and much thanks for it, goes to our members who continued to pay their dues during this difficult time. Budget and Reserves 101 CLC ASSOCIATION The Finance Committee would like our Members to have an understanding of our Budget and Reserve Schedules. The following is in an effort to walk you through these two documents and the differences between them. The Budget is for the day to day operation of the community think of it as checkbook for dailymonthly operating expenses and the Reserve schedule is for replacement of large assets such as major building repairs or renovations, trucks and larger equipment replacement think of it as a savings account. Budget: For those of you who may not know this, unlike a number of communities in the area, our members vote on the budget. The CLCA budget is worked on by the Finance Committee. As with all of our Committees, any member in good standing is welcome to attend the meetings. Work on the budget typically begins in June. Averages of actual expenses for the past four years are the starting point to working on the budget. Additional consideration for projected increases or decreases in costs are also looked at and adjusted accordingly. There are two parts to the budget Inflows money in and General Operating expensesmoney out. The totals for each of those sections must be the same. That is a balanced budget. There are lines for inflows including dues. It is important to not confuse Inflows incomemoney in with General Operating Expenses money out. Income: The primary source of income is dues. If you look at the bottom right side of the page for the proposed 20202021 Budget you will note the number of homes, lots and contiguous lots. If you take the number from the Homeowners dues inflow line 695,887.00 and divide it by the number of homes 569 your answer is 1223.00 proposed dues for homes the same math applies for lots and contiguous lots. Dues discount is a projected amount of money that will reduce dues income as a result of members taking advantage of this payment option. The doubtful account line is the projected amount of money we will not receive from members who fail to pay their dues. This could be for a number of reasons valid and non-valid including but not limited to, foreclosure, bankruptcy, hardship, lack of priorities, abandonment of lots to foreclosure and tax sales. Effort is made whenever legally possible to pursue unpaid dues by the office staff, our attorney and through the legal system. Other Inflowsincome are estimated based on history and projection. Income from resale certificates and transfer fees can fluctuate depending on the home market. Expenses There are three different payroll expense lines, one for the office, one for maintenance and the third payroll is included in the pool supplies and operations. Payroll bonus applies to all permanent employees. Currently there are 8. There are two lines for the Dam. There are two road lines. One is for repair of the roads which can include materials such as stone, culvert pipes, wood for guide rails, signage etc. In addition to the road repair line there is a road reserve line. In the past those funds were utilized to pave dirt roads. Future funds to this account will include major repairs to maintain the roads. Miscellaneous expense can cover a number of expenses. Donations to the Fire Department, Humane Society or additional educational expenses for staff that may be needed and are over and above training budget. Reserves On the reverse side of the Budget is the General Reserve schedule. This lists CLCAs larger owned assets. Nothing lasts forever and will eventually need to be repaired, roofed, sided, windows, septic, well pumps, restored or totally replaced or expanded. These funds are for that purpose. While we have these items insured, maintenance, deterioration and wear and tear are not covered by insurance. Thanks to reserves, Conashaugh is free of loans and interest payments for those loans. Reserves have also deterred the need to charge members for long term additional assessments. Not too many HOAs can say that. The list is reviewed and items no longer owned and or replaced are removed or updated. Funds for removed items that are no longer needed are redistributed to underfunded lines. It should also be noted that the schedule of listed assets are periodically reviewed and the replacement cost may need to be adjusted up or down. As for the reserve schedule, the first column after the asset description is the original cost for that item. The amounts funded for certain items were questioned in the past. The funded amounts for the individual line items are not set in stone. In other words, if needed or decided those funds can be moved to another item. An example of what is being said here is as follows: Say that a vehicle or piece of equipment failed beyond repair and replacement was necessary. The replacement cost for that item by either or new or used item is 10,000 but the reserve line for that item was only funded for 5,000.00. The additional 5,000.00 could be moved from another item or items to make up the difference to enable the replacement. Hopefully the above will clarify some of the information concerning the proposed budget and reserve schedule. If you have any questions, please contact the office. Although there is a zero proposed increase, it is very important for the Membership to vote. We must have a budget to operate and a quorum at least 10 of the membership for the vote. If you have not received your Annual Meeting packet, please contact the office. Thank you",

Although we are a private Community we are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. They have full access to the Community and do come in to enforce rules including but not limited to possession of fishing licenses and boat safety equipment. Be aware of life jacket and safety equipment that is required when on the water. All children 12 years of age and younger on all Commonwealth waters must wear a life jacket while underway on any boat 20 feet in length or less and on all canoes and kayaks. Underway includes drifting boats. For boating and fishing rules please visit: https:www.fishandboat.comPagesdefault.aspx Dont be fooled by a warm beautiful day, especially in the spring and fall. Water temps are still frigid. Cold water can kill quickly. You can be a great swimmer but you cannot swim when overcome by hypothermia. Life jackets are required to be worn by all between November 1 through April 30th when on a boat 16 feet or less and all canoes and kayaks. Although we are not in ice season, it will come soon enough.

The year 2020, a new decade, a leap year, the third millennium which I hope will be an awesome year for us all. I am the new President of the Board for the current CLCA fiscal year. I feel honored to have been asked and voted unanimously to serve in this position. Conashaugh has made awesome strides in the past thanks to some very dedicated people who live or have lived in this community and volunteered their time to make us a fabulous and financially responsible community. Yes we are great with an approximate 95 dues collection rate, and we are able to do what is necessary to keep this community a beautiful and sought after place to buy or build in the Poconos. We have accomplished a lot in the past year. We paved eleven roads leaving only eleven roads to be paved before the entire community has completed our goal of paving all dirt roads. Our playground was enhanced with new equipment and the Community made a collective decision to move the compactor to make a more accessible and safer disposal area for everyone in the community. These projects were and will be accomplished without taking a loan or burdening our members with a special assessment. I would like to thank the many worker bees of this community that volunteer their time to make us great. The nine awesome Board Members you voted for, the men that volunteer to make our community the clean and well-kept community we are every Dumpster Day, the Recreation volunteers who feed and occupy our little ones during the holidays, the neighbors who walk our streets and pick up after all of us and watch for our pets when they decide to talk an unscheduled walk. Last but not least, we have an awesome office staff that works tirelessly to accommodate all of our questions and problems and a fabulous maintenance crew that help make this a great community to live. Be safe on the roads and I look forward to a great, successful and healthy 2020 with all of you.

Join me in CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2020 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION Conashaugh Is For The Birds On a nice October 7 th morning one of our residents Gary Hill contacted the office. There was this white bird on his property. It wouldnt leave and was following him all around. Eventually it followed him into his garage. Not wanting to see this nice bird becoming a meal for a predator, Gary captured it in a box with a screen on top and contacted the office to see if anyone had reported it as missing. While weve had our share of flighty pets, this bird was a first. Since Gary had to leave Conashaugh, he brought the bird to the office to advertise the found bird. The bird did not appear frightened, was very calm and easy to handle. A nice cage with a perch was put together and the bird was named. Lucky Luigi had what may have been his first photo session and up he went onto our Facebook page. Although some recognized the bird as one seen recently on their properties, no one claimed it. While Luigi was enjoying his five minutes of fame on Facebook searches began on GOOGLE to figure out a proper diet for him and the meaning of the little band on his leg. It was quickly discovered that the numbered band identified him as belonging to the National Pigeon Association. The search also reaped contact information for the NPA and so the quest to find Luigis owner began. A secretary for NPA responded quickly to verify the number which traced the bird back to the supplier of the band which was in New Brighton, Pennsylvania a mere 325 miles from here. A call to the supplier directed us to the birds ownerbreeder who lived in Glendale, Queens NY. The owner was contacted and very happy to hear the bird was safe. Now one might think how in the world did Luigi find his way from Queens to Pike County? Well as it turned out a couple of things were discovered. First, Luigi was a female thus renamed Lucky Louise and her owner, who flies pigeons has a second home in Hawley. He brings his birds here in the summerfall to fly them and then back to Queens. The owner went to his pen one day and discovered that something happened that enabled three of his birds to escape. One of the birds returned but two did not. Louise was one of the two missing birds. The owner was in Queens at the time he was reached but returned the next day and happily retrieved his bird. He was very thankful for the concern and rescue by Gary and the care received while waiting to be picked up. We were very happy to be a part of this happy reunion. Conashaugh welcomes the Tosto Piechowski family from New York City. Adam and Christina along with their children Suraya and Xeren are our newest residents. We wish much happiness in your new home! WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD! CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2020 PAGE 6 CLC ASSOCIATION Security On October 1, 2019 Conashaugh entered into a contract with a new Security Company. Officers formerly from Patriot Security, now under the brand St. Moritz Security, have been extremely diligent with addressing drivers who dont fully stop at stop signs, drive recklessly and speed within the Community. For the most part encounters with our members and their guests have been positive. It is important for all to know that last year the Rules and Regulations Committee submitted recommendations which were approved by the Board with regard to fines associated with speeding and eluding Security. Those fines are as follows: Speed Fine 1-10 mph over the posted speed limit 50.00 11-20 mph over the posted speed limit 100.00 21 mph over the posted speed limit 150.00 For repeat offenders the fines double for second and triple for third offense within one year. What Not to do When Being Stopped by Security Here are some friendly reminders:  Dont run  the Security vehicles are equipped with lights and a siren. When you hear and see them pull over in a safe location.  Fines for running or better known as eluding are 150.00 first offense, 300.00 second offense and 450.00 for a third offense.  When asked for vehicle documents do not tell the officer to get them from the office. If you do not produce the requested documents license, registration and insurance card you will receive a 50.00 ticket for each document not produced. In order for those tickets to be contested you will need to then bring copies of the requested documents to security or the office.  Dont tell the officers that they are not the police. You are right, they are not the police. They are here to enforce driving rules of the road. The rules everyone buys into when they purchase a home or property in the Community.  Dont be rude. Cursing or screaming at the officer for doing his or her job is not recommended. The Security vehicle is equipped with a dash cam and the officer a body cam. Stop Signs and Speed Limits California Rolls dont roll here. Please be sure to stop fully break in the momentum of the wheels of your vehicle at all stop signs. All unpaved roads plus recreation areasbasketball court on Overbrook, the beach at Sandy Pine, Seneca Drive at Seneca Lake, Flatbrook Way at the enhanced wetlands are all have a 15mph speed limit. Last but not least, the maximum speed limit in the Community is 25 mph. Due Process It is important for everyone to be aware of their right to due process. In the event that you should be on the receiving end of a violation that you wish to contest, simply deliver a written request to the office for a hearing within thirty days. It is not necessary to indicate on your request why you are contesting the violation, however, please feel free to do so if that is your wish. You will be notified of a hearing date and required to attend. Your case will be heard by Members of the Hearing Committee who are Community volunteers. Evidence of the violation will be presented to the Committee. The Committee will send their recommendation to the Board of Directors for a final decision regarding the violation. While increased traffic enforcement has resulted in noticeable improvement with regard to traffic rules being followed, there remains a need for improved compliance. Concerns and compliments about Security may be referred to the office. Attention Seniors Each month the Pike County Area on Aging issues a newsletter. We share that newsletter via the LOOP.

Specifically, a powder horn, pocket pistol, ball shot and various other items. I found that Wesley and his wife lived in Southampton, NJ. The artifacts were passed down through the years and finally to me. I contacted Passed Artifacts Lead to Long Line of Significant Ancestors BY CHET SITGREAVES the Southampton Historical Museum and they said they would accept these artifacts as a donation to display. My interest was piqued, so I developed my Sitgreaves Family Tree. I discovered that Sara Sitgreaves, in England, 1667-1727 was the matriarch of the family. William Sitgreaves, the son of Sara, and his wife Mary sailed from England to America aboard the Watts Galley. After sailing for a month on the high seas they arrived in Philadelphia, PA in 1729. They acquired property in both Philadelphia, PA and Beaufort, NC. They had four children, the first died as an infant, 2nd was William Jr. third was Thomas and 4th was Sara. William Jr. and wife Susan Deschon had nine children. My Significant ancestors are: Samuel Sitgreaves 1764-1827, born in Philadelphia and lived in Easton,PA. He was one of the delegates chosen by Gov. William Penn to author the Pennsylvania Constitution during the Convention of 1790. He was also a U.S. House of Representative from PA. Judge John Sitgreaves 1757- 1802, was nominated by President John Adams for the Fifth Circuit Court, but he declined and instead served as a Federal District Court Judge in NC. Charles Sitgreaves 1803- 1878, was a U.S. Congressman and the first Mayor of Phillipsburg, NJ. Wesley Sitgreaves 1804- 1878, was a carpenter and he and his wife moved to Southampton, NJ and raised a son William.This is where the artifacts came from Colonel Lorenzo Sitgreaves 1810-1888 son of Samuel Sitgreaves, was a West Point Military Graduate. He was a topographical engineer commissioned by the U.S. Gov. to map a trail West to CA. For his accomplishments the Gov. named the Apache Sitgreaves National Forest in AZ, in his honor. He also was a Mexican War Veteran. William Sitgreaves Cox 1790-1874 was a U.S. Naval Officer during The War of 1812. His war service ended at the Battle of Boston Harbor in 1813. Capt.James Lawrence was in charge of the USS Chesapeake when it came in contact with the HMS Shannon. During the battle Capt. Lawrence was mortally wounded, his last words were, Dont give up the ship. William became the Lieutenant in charge. Because the USS Chesapeake was boarded by the English Navy and lost the battle, William was court - martialed and discharged from the Navy. After advocacy from his descendants, his rank was restored by President Harry S. Truman. It is quite amazing how these people went through so much history when the United States of America was being born. The Revolutionary War 1775-1783, our Thirteen American Colonies declared independence from Great Britain. The War of 1812 1812-1815, the United States fought the United Kingdom. The Civil War 1861-1865 the Northern United States fought the Eleven Southern States.

Blue skies dominated the skies and there wasnt so much as a breeze to be felt. A call came in about a huge tree that dropped across Seneca between Flatbrook and Beaver Run. A road closure notice was posted on Facebook. Shortly after the post volunteers began the removal of the tree and the road was cleared. Thank you to Steve and Stevie Hamilton who along with Eddie Calabrese, Ethan Thompson worked cutting up the tree. Patti Havekost was there with broom in hand sweeping debris off the road. Lisa, Ethans wife came to the scene with refreshments. Thank you to all who volunteered their time to clear the roadway. On the early morning of October 11, 2019 residents Mike Bernazzani and Gerald Ungerer reported an incident involving vandalism to some boats located at the boat rack. The boats were sprayed with graffiti. Both Mike and Gerald jumped into action and cleaned off the boats. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this kind act! No kids Christmas party would be complete without a special visit from Santa Claus. A jolly thank you to Gary Linton who made sure that Santa made an appearance with his sidekick elf, Stevie Hamilton.

They shared their wonderful painting skills with members who attended Paint a Snowman and a Vintage Truck with Christmas Tree classes. Watch for announcements regarding future classes. Playground Addition Research was done by Patti Havekost and submitted to the Board for review and approval. The goal was to have the equipment installed for the summer. The area was cleared of sand and replaced with good soil by maintenance and footings were set. Unfortunately upon setting the main posts for the set it was discovered that three of the main supports that were sent were incorrect. The manufacturer was contacted and sent out the proper poles but in the meantime work on roads that were planned for paving began leaving the project to be continued after the road work was completed. There are plans for additional aesthetic improvements to be done this year to the area as well as a dedication of the playground. Thank you Patti for doing the legwork to shop for comparison prices and working with the manufacturer for us. Thank you to Dave, Craig and Bruce from Maintenance for doing the install on this project. This past fall an addition was made to our playground on Sandy Pine Trail. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2020 PAGE 12 CONASHAUGH NEWS ALL OTHER TIMES CALL DISPATCH FOR ST. MORITZ SECURITY 570-252-6050 REQUEST OFFICER TO REPORT TO CONASHAUGH COMPACTOR DO NOT LEAVE TRASH ON THE GROUND Please note that we are not St. Mortizs only client and it is important to let them know the location. Effective February 1st 2020 The compactor will close daily at 8:00 p.m. Compactor will be closed during all power outages and may be closed due to weather conditions Do not leave trash. Thank you. RECYCLING Good For Your Wallet Thank you to our many residents who participate in our recycling program. It has been in place since the summer of 2010. We currently have four bins that are emptied two times per week. Those bins can hold up to approximately 1600 pounds of recycling each. The bins are dumped 2 times per week or 8 visits a month which amounts to 32 total bins tipped per month. If you multiply the weight at 1,600 lbs each that equals 51,200 lbs or 25-12 tons. We are charged a flat rate for this service. Now, if all of that recycling went into the compactors it would amount to more than two compactors full of trash which would cost approximately 2,000.00 to haul per month or 24,000.00 per year. We would like to continue providing this service. Recent developments with China no longer accepting recyclables from the US have had an impact to the costs of recycling and its future is unclear. In the meantime we will continue with the program and hope that if you are reading this and havent been a recycler that you will consider giving it a try. Please dont be a recycle bin hog. Remove all Styrofoam and deposit in the regular trash and flatten all boxes when recycling. Styrofoam is not an accepted recyclable with our carrier and intact boxes take up a lot space in the bins not allowing others room to recycle. Also please do not throw plastic bags in recycling. There is a receptacle for disposal of plastic bags. If the bins are full do not keep stacking items or leave them on the ground. Thank you. As the old saying goes, it is better to rule from the bottom up than rule from the top down. What does that mean? Example, there is no rule that members have to pick up after their dogs. Its something that is the right thing to do and common sense if not courtesy. No one finds joy scraping your dogs feculence from their shoes or kids toys. No one wants to be hassled by security asking to see your bags, right? Thats just annoying. So save a lot of aggravation all around and pick up after your dog, please. Thank you. Friendly Reminder If you are planning to pave your driveway, please contact the office for a no cost inspection by maintenance. This inspection is to determine if you need to install or replace a culvert pipe. Please do this in advance of arranging a date for paving. Thank you. COMPACTOR FULL?

If you are an owner selling your property and have any questions on this subject, please contact the office. Say Hello to Our Little Friends! a barrier at the sluice drain to prevent our friends from swimming elsewhere! Triploid Carp are not fishable. They only eat weeds. While they have no problem doing that, they are unable to be caught on a hook. Their mouths are not suited for that. They do like to swim near the shallow areas of the lake and their dorsal fins may stick out of the water so, dont be alarmed if you see them. There are no sharks in Conashaugh Lake! Triploid carp are regulated and the number of fish permitted to be stocked is based on the size of the body of water. We are looking forward to seeing what these little guys can do for our lake. It is a much less aggressive approach than using chemicals for weed control. CALL 845-456-1218 TO ADVERTISE TODAY! CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2020 PAGE 14 Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are in our future. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, others may not be as familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. What is a road ban? It is a period of time when vehicles exceeding 10,000 lbs are prohibited entry in the Community. How long do they last? These bans are to protect our roads from damage during thaw periods. We are permitted a total of eight weeks for the bans. Mother Nature has proven fickle this year with freezing temperatures in early December to spring-like weather in January. Whether a ban will take place is determined by weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. Maintenance personnel inspect road and weather conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP, our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.com conashaughlakes and website, www.conashaughlakes.com. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they were not aware or forgot about bans. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the members only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation.

The vote results were 142 for the move and 46 against the move. Design plans for the area were published in the 2019 Annual Meeting Issue of the Courier published in August. The plan is for the project break ground in MayJune 2020. In the meantime lots have to be combined and the services of Thomas Farley our attorney have been requested to handle that process. Trash hauling costs have increased in the past year. Currently we are paying 67.00 for each ton of trash taken out of here excluding recyclables. In addition to the cost per ton there is a hauling charge of 325.00 for the carrier to remove the full container and replace it with an empty one. Each container holds approximately ten tons of trash. The average cost each time a container is removed is approximately 1,000.00. If you multiply that number by the number of pulls each month between three and four we are looking at approximate costs in the range of 3500.00 per month or 42,000.00 per year. With China not accepting recyclables from the US costs have also increased. With the new compactor area will come changes in operation. Controls are needed to ensure that our trash costs are not the result of paying for trash that is not ours. Recently, compactor hours have been slightly reduced and are listed elsewhere in this publication. The details of the operation have not been ironed out, however, it can be anticipated to be more regulated than it has in the past with reduced hours and increased manning. As part of a review of usage, hours and traffic there may be periods where users may be asked for identification when using the compactor. Please do not take this personally or as invasive. There is a reason for it. Intermittent reports continue to be received concerning the placement of items not belonging in the compactors. Items such as trash from businesses, contractors, furniture, wall to wall carpeting, construction debris, televisions and tires to name a few things, continue to be found, though occasionally, in the compactor and recycling areas. We hold dumpster day twice per year for the disposal of larger items not permitted in the compactor. Members who own or work for businesses that result in trash are not to be placing those items in the compactor. The same applies to recycling. Intermittent reports continue to be received of people who do not live here being seen using the compactor. Persons reporting this activity have not filed formal reports but will mention it. Without specifics such as the date and time of the activity or delayed reporting it is difficult to find video footage of the event. Anyones cards found used by persons not living here for the purpose of dumping garbage will be deactivated permanently regardless if it a loaned or Associate card. When a member rents their home the use of amenities is to be by their tenants only. Amenity use for landlords unless they live within the Community are suspended. Members who rent their homes to others are not to use amenities including trash. Allowing others access to our trash area can and will have an impact to our expenses for this service. That cost is passed to the dues paying members. Do you think its fair to pay your hard earn money for a service to be used by others who have no business using it? Probably not. If you observe someone who is not a Community member using the trash, please contact the office within 24 hours with information including the date and time. CONASHAUGH NEWS Trash Talk Important Reminder Regarding Associate Gate Cards Associate card holders must use the main entrance to enter the Community via the card access at the main entrance. Associate Gate Cards no longer work at the member only Seneca gate. Please be sure to alert your Associate card holders. Associates may include family members, relatives or others who do not live with you but may visit frequently. Members are permitted up to two Associate Gate cards per household. Use by contractors is not permitted. A vehicle registration must be presented along with a non- refundable fee of 25.00 per card to obtain an Associate card. Associate cards are not to be used to for the purpose of accessing CLCA amenities such as the compactor and recycling. Associate cards observed being used for this purpose will be deactivated permanently and not restored. There is also a risk of a 500.00 fine.

The year 2020, a new decade, a leap year, the third millennium which I hope will be an awesome year for us all. I am the new President of the Board for the current CLCA fiscal year. I feel honored to have been asked and voted unanimously to serve in this position. Conashaugh has made awesome strides in the past thanks to some very dedicated people who live or have lived in this community and volunteered their time to make us a fabulous and financially responsible community. Yes we are great with an approximate 95 dues collection rate, and we are able to do what is necessary to keep this community a beautiful and sought after place to buy or build in the Poconos. We have accomplished a lot in the past year. We paved eleven roads leaving only eleven roads to be paved before the entire community has completed our goal of paving all dirt roads. Our playground was enhanced with new equipment and the Community made a collective decision to move the compactor to make a more accessible and safer disposal area for everyone in the community. These projects were and will be accomplished without taking a loan or burdening our members with a special assessment. I would like to thank the many worker bees of this community that volunteer their time to make us great. The nine awesome Board Members you voted for, the men that volunteer to make our community the clean and well-kept community we are every Dumpster Day, the Recreation volunteers who feed and occupy our little ones during the holidays, the neighbors who walk our streets and pick up after all of us and watch for our pets when they decide to talk an unscheduled walk. Last but not least, we have an awesome office staff that works tirelessly to accommodate all of our questions and problems and a fabulous maintenance crew that help make this a great community to live. Be safe on the roads and I look forward to a great, successful and healthy 2020 with all of you. Patti Havekost",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2020 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION Conashaugh Is For The Birds On a nice October 7 th morning one of our residents Gary Hill contacted the office. There was this white bird on his property. It wouldnt leave and was following him all around. Eventually it followed him into his garage. Not wanting to see this nice bird becoming a meal for a predator, Gary captured it in a box with a screen on top and contacted the office to see if anyone had reported it as missing. While weve had our share of flighty pets, this bird was a first. Since Gary had to leave Conashaugh, he brought the bird to the office to advertise the found bird. The bird did not appear frightened, was very calm and easy to handle. A nice cage with a perch was put together and the bird was named. Lucky Luigi had what may have been his first photo session and up he went onto our Facebook page. Although some recognized the bird as one seen recently on their properties, no one claimed it. While Luigi was enjoying his five minutes of fame on Facebook searches began on GOOGLE to figure out a proper diet for him and the meaning of the little band on his leg. It was quickly discovered that the numbered band identified him as belonging to the National Pigeon Association. The search also reaped contact information for the NPA and so the quest to find Luigis owner began. A secretary for NPA responded quickly to verify the number which traced the bird back to the supplier of the band which was in New Brighton, Pennsylvania a mere 325 miles from here. A call to the supplier directed us to the birds ownerbreeder who lived in Glendale, Queens NY. The owner was contacted and very happy to hear the bird was safe. Now one might think how in the world did Luigi find his way from Queens to Pike County? Well as it turned out a couple of things were discovered. First, Luigi was a female thus renamed Lucky Louise and her owner, who flies pigeons has a second home in Hawley. He brings his birds here in the summerfall to fly them and then back to Queens. The owner went to his pen one day and discovered that something happened that enabled three of his birds to escape. One of the birds returned but two did not. Louise was one of the two missing birds. The owner was in Queens at the time he was reached but returned the next day and happily retrieved his bird. He was very thankful for the concern and rescue by Gary and the care received while waiting to be picked up. We were very happy to be a part of this happy reunion. Conashaugh welcomes the Tosto Piechowski family from New York City. Adam and Christina along with their children Suraya and Xeren are our newest residents. We wish much happiness in your new home!

Officers formerly from Patriot Security, now under the brand St. Moritz Security, have been extremely diligent with addressing drivers who dont fully stop at stop signs, drive recklessly and speed within the Community. For the most part encounters with our members and their guests have been positive. It is important for all to know that last year the Rules and Regulations Committee submitted recommendations which were approved by the Board with regard to fines associated with speeding and eluding Security. Those fines are as follows: Speed Fine 1-10 mph over the posted speed limit 50.00 11-20 mph over the posted speed limit 100.00 21 mph over the posted speed limit 150.00 For repeat offenders the fines double for second and triple for third offense within one year. What Not to do When Being Stopped by Security Here are some friendly reminders:  Dont run  the Security vehicles are equipped with lights and a siren. When you hear and see them pull over in a safe location.  Fines for running or better known as eluding are 150.00 first offense, 300.00 second offense and 450.00 for a third offense.  When asked for vehicle documents do not tell the officer to get them from the office. If you do not produce the requested documents license, registration and insurance card you will receive a 50.00 ticket for each document not produced. In order for those tickets to be contested you will need to then bring copies of the requested documents to security or the office.  Dont tell the officers that they are not the police. You are right, they are not the police. They are here to enforce driving rules of the road. The rules everyone buys into when they purchase a home or property in the Community.  Dont be rude. Cursing or screaming at the officer for doing his or her job is not recommended. The Security vehicle is equipped with a dash cam and the officer a body cam. Stop Signs and Speed Limits California Rolls dont roll here. Please be sure to stop fully break in the momentum of the wheels of your vehicle at all stop signs. All unpaved roads plus recreation areasbasketball court on Overbrook, the beach at Sandy Pine, Seneca Drive at Seneca Lake, Flatbrook Way at the enhanced wetlands are all have a 15mph speed limit. Last but not least, the maximum speed limit in the Community is 25 mph. Due Process It is important for everyone to be aware of their right to due process. In the event that you should be on the receiving end of a violation that you wish to contest, simply deliver a written request to the office for a hearing within thirty days. It is not necessary to indicate on your request why you are contesting the violation, however, please feel free to do so if that is your wish. You will be notified of a hearing date and required to attend. Your case will be heard by Members of the Hearing Committee who are Community volunteers. Evidence of the violation will be presented to the Committee. The Committee will send their recommendation to the Board of Directors for a final decision regarding the violation. While increased traffic enforcement has resulted in noticeable improvement with regard to traffic rules being followed, there remains a need for improved compliance. Concerns and compliments about Security may be referred to the office. Attention Seniors Each month the Pike County Area on Aging issues a newsletter. We share that newsletter via the LOOP. Printed copies are also available at the CLCA Office. IMPORTANT REMINDER All members receiving mail in Conashaugh Lakes must be sure to update your mailing information with your billing companies, the tax collector or anyone else who may be sending. We have been advised by the post office that mail addressed to a four digit Conashaugh mailbox will be returned to the senders.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2020 PAGE 8 CONASHAUGH NEWS I had artifacts belonging to one of my ancestors, Wesley Sitgreaves that dated back to the year 1828. Specifically, a powder horn, pocket pistol, ball shot and various other items. I found that Wesley and his wife lived in Southampton, NJ. The artifacts were passed down through the years and finally to me. I contacted Passed Artifacts Lead to Long Line of Significant Ancestors BY CHET SITGREAVES the Southampton Historical Museum and they said they would accept these artifacts as a donation to display. My interest was piqued, so I developed my Sitgreaves Family Tree. I discovered that Sara Sitgreaves, in England, 1667-1727 was the matriarch of the family. William Sitgreaves, the son of Sara, and his wife Mary sailed from England to America aboard the Watts Galley. After sailing for a month on the high seas they arrived in Philadelphia, PA in 1729. They acquired property in both Philadelphia, PA and Beaufort, NC. They had four children, the first died as an infant, 2nd was William Jr. third was Thomas and 4th was Sara. William Jr. and wife Susan Deschon had nine children. My Significant ancestors are: Samuel Sitgreaves 1764-1827, born in Philadelphia and lived in Easton,PA. He was one of the delegates chosen by Gov. William Penn to author the Pennsylvania Constitution during the Convention of 1790. He was also a U.S. House of Representative from PA. Judge John Sitgreaves 1757- 1802, was nominated by President John Adams for the Fifth Circuit Court, but he declined and instead served as a Federal District Court Judge in NC. Charles Sitgreaves 1803- 1878, was a U.S. Congressman and the first Mayor of Phillipsburg, NJ. Wesley Sitgreaves 1804- 1878, was a carpenter and he and his wife moved to Southampton, NJ and raised a son William.This is where the artifacts came from Colonel Lorenzo Sitgreaves 1810-1888 son of Samuel Sitgreaves, was a West Point Military Graduate. He was a topographical engineer commissioned by the U.S. Gov. to map a trail West to CA. For his accomplishments the Gov. named the Apache Sitgreaves National Forest in AZ, in his honor. He also was a Mexican War Veteran. William Sitgreaves Cox 1790-1874 was a U.S. Naval Officer during The War of 1812. His war service ended at the Battle of Boston Harbor in 1813. Capt.James Lawrence was in charge of the USS Chesapeake when it came in contact with the HMS Shannon. During the battle Capt. Lawrence was mortally wounded, his last words were, Dont give up the ship. William became the Lieutenant in charge. Because the USS Chesapeake was boarded by the English Navy and lost the battle, William was court - martialed and discharged from the Navy. After advocacy from his descendants, his rank was restored by President Harry S. Truman. It is quite amazing how these people went through so much history when the United States of America was being born. The Revolutionary War 1775-1783, our Thirteen American Colonies declared independence from Great Britain. The War of 1812 1812-1815, the United States fought the United Kingdom. The Civil War 1861-1865 the Northern United States fought the Eleven Southern States.",

Blue skies dominated the skies and there wasnt so much as a breeze to be felt. A call came in about a huge tree that dropped across Seneca between Flatbrook and Beaver Run. A road closure notice was posted on Facebook. Shortly after the post volunteers began the removal of the tree and the road was cleared. Thank you to Steve and Stevie Hamilton who along with Eddie Calabrese, Ethan Thompson worked cutting up the tree. Patti Havekost was there with broom in hand sweeping debris off the road. Lisa, Ethans wife came to the scene with refreshments. Thank you to all who volunteered their time to clear the roadway. On the early morning of October 11, 2019 residents Mike Bernazzani and Gerald Ungerer reported an incident involving vandalism to some boats located at the boat rack. The boats were sprayed with graffiti. Both Mike and Gerald jumped into action and cleaned off the boats. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this kind act! No kids Christmas party would be complete without a special visit from Santa Claus. A jolly thank you to Gary Linton who made sure that Santa made an appearance with his sidekick elf, Stevie Hamilton. He along with the Rec Committee did a great job once again bringing smiles to Community kids at this Annual event. Thank you to everyone who gives of their time and contributes to our Community, our home. Whether you take a few minutes to pick up in front of your home or walk our roads doing the same or are member of the Board or Committees, your participation is needed and appreciated.

They shared their wonderful painting skills with members who attended Paint a Snowman and a Vintage Truck with Christmas Tree classes. Watch for announcements regarding future classes. Playground Addition Research was done by Patti Havekost and submitted to the Board for review and approval. The goal was to have the equipment installed for the summer. The area was cleared of sand and replaced with good soil by maintenance and footings were set. Unfortunately upon setting the main posts for the set it was discovered that three of the main supports that were sent were incorrect. The manufacturer was contacted and sent out the proper poles but in the meantime work on roads that were planned for paving began leaving the project to be continued after the road work was completed. There are plans for additional aesthetic improvements to be done this year to the area as well as a dedication of the playground. Thank you Patti for doing the legwork to shop for comparison prices and working with the manufacturer for us. Thank you to Dave, Craig and Bruce from Maintenance for doing the install on this project. This past fall an addition was made to our playground on Sandy Pine Trail.",

MORITZ SECURITY 570-252-6050 REQUEST OFFICER TO REPORT TO CONASHAUGH COMPACTOR DO NOT LEAVE TRASH ON THE GROUND Please note that we are not St. Mortizs only client and it is important to let them know the location. Effective February 1st 2020 The compactor will close daily at 8:00 p.m. Compactor will be closed during all power outages and may be closed due to weather conditions Do not leave trash. Thank you. RECYCLING Good For Your Wallet Thank you to our many residents who participate in our recycling program. It has been in place since the summer of 2010. We currently have four bins that are emptied two times per week. Those bins can hold up to approximately 1600 pounds of recycling each. The bins are dumped 2 times per week or 8 visits a month which amounts to 32 total bins tipped per month. If you multiply the weight at 1,600 lbs each that equals 51,200 lbs or 25-12 tons. We are charged a flat rate for this service. Now, if all of that recycling went into the compactors it would amount to more than two compactors full of trash which would cost approximately 2,000.00 to haul per month or 24,000.00 per year. We would like to continue providing this service. Recent developments with China no longer accepting recyclables from the US have had an impact to the costs of recycling and its future is unclear. In the meantime we will continue with the program and hope that if you are reading this and havent been a recycler that you will consider giving it a try. Please dont be a recycle bin hog. Remove all Styrofoam and deposit in the regular trash and flatten all boxes when recycling. Styrofoam is not an accepted recyclable with our carrier and intact boxes take up a lot space in the bins not allowing others room to recycle. Also please do not throw plastic bags in recycling. There is a receptacle for disposal of plastic bags. If the bins are full do not keep stacking items or leave them on the ground. Thank you. As the old saying goes, it is better to rule from the bottom up than rule from the top down. What does that mean? Example, there is no rule that members have to pick up after their dogs. Its something that is the right thing to do and common sense if not courtesy. No one finds joy scraping your dogs feculence from their shoes or kids toys. No one wants to be hassled by security asking to see your bags, right? Thats just annoying. So save a lot of aggravation all around and pick up after your dog, please. Thank you. Friendly Reminder If you are planning to pave your driveway, please contact the office for a no cost inspection by maintenance. This inspection is to determine if you need to install or replace a culvert pipe. Please do this in advance of arranging a date for paving. Thank you. COMPACTOR FULL?

They are a sterile carp whose job is to eat weeds in the lake! Thank you to Natureworks of Lake Aerial who conducted the study for this project, The PA Fish and Boat for issuing the permit that was needed, Schultzs Fish Hatchery for delivering the fish and last but not least Dave and Craig from Maintenance for introducing the carp to their new home and volunteers Larry Farnum and Neil Johnson for installing Are You Selling Your Property?

If you are an owner selling your property and have any questions on this subject, please contact the office. Say Hello to Our Little Friends! a barrier at the sluice drain to prevent our friends from swimming elsewhere! Triploid Carp are not fishable. They only eat weeds. While they have no problem doing that, they are unable to be caught on a hook. Their mouths are not suited for that. They do like to swim near the shallow areas of the lake and their dorsal fins may stick out of the water so, dont be alarmed if you see them. There are no sharks in Conashaugh Lake! Triploid carp are regulated and the number of fish permitted to be stocked is based on the size of the body of water. We are looking forward to seeing what these little guys can do for our lake. It is a much less aggressive approach than using chemicals for weed control. CALL 845-456-1218 TO ADVERTISE TODAY!",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2020 PAGE 14 Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are in our future. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, others may not be as familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. What is a road ban? It is a period of time when vehicles exceeding 10,000 lbs are prohibited entry in the Community. How long do they last? These bans are to protect our roads from damage during thaw periods. We are permitted a total of eight weeks for the bans. Mother Nature has proven fickle this year with freezing temperatures in early December to spring-like weather in January. Whether a ban will take place is determined by weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. Maintenance personnel inspect road and weather conditions and advise when to institute the ban. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP, our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.com conashaughlakes and website, www.conashaughlakes.com. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they were not aware or forgot about bans. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the members only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2020 PAGE 15 As announced following the Annual Meeting and vote held on September 28, 2019 the compactors will be relocated. The vote results were 142 for the move and 46 against the move. Design plans for the area were published in the 2019 Annual Meeting Issue of the Courier published in August. The plan is for the project break ground in MayJune 2020. In the meantime lots have to be combined and the services of Thomas Farley our attorney have been requested to handle that process. Trash hauling costs have increased in the past year. Currently we are paying 67.00 for each ton of trash taken out of here excluding recyclables. In addition to the cost per ton there is a hauling charge of 325.00 for the carrier to remove the full container and replace it with an empty one. Each container holds approximately ten tons of trash. The average cost each time a container is removed is approximately 1,000.00. If you multiply that number by the number of pulls each month between three and four we are looking at approximate costs in the range of 3500.00 per month or 42,000.00 per year. With China not accepting recyclables from the US costs have also increased. With the new compactor area will come changes in operation. Controls are needed to ensure that our trash costs are not the result of paying for trash that is not ours. Recently, compactor hours have been slightly reduced and are listed elsewhere in this publication. The details of the operation have not been ironed out, however, it can be anticipated to be more regulated than it has in the past with reduced hours and increased manning. As part of a review of usage, hours and traffic there may be periods where users may be asked for identification when using the compactor. Please do not take this personally or as invasive. There is a reason for it. Intermittent reports continue to be received concerning the placement of items not belonging in the compactors. Items such as trash from businesses, contractors, furniture, wall to wall carpeting, construction debris, televisions and tires to name a few things, continue to be found, though occasionally, in the compactor and recycling areas. We hold dumpster day twice per year for the disposal of larger items not permitted in the compactor. Members who own or work for businesses that result in trash are not to be placing those items in the compactor. The same applies to recycling. Intermittent reports continue to be received of people who do not live here being seen using the compactor. Persons reporting this activity have not filed formal reports but will mention it. Without specifics such as the date and time of the activity or delayed reporting it is difficult to find video footage of the event. Anyones cards found used by persons not living here for the purpose of dumping garbage will be deactivated permanently regardless if it a loaned or Associate card. When a member rents their home the use of amenities is to be by their tenants only. Amenity use for landlords unless they live within the Community are suspended. Members who rent their homes to others are not to use amenities including trash. Allowing others access to our trash area can and will have an impact to our expenses for this service. That cost is passed to the dues paying members. Do you think its fair to pay your hard earn money for a service to be used by others who have no business using it? Probably not. If you observe someone who is not a Community member using the trash, please contact the office within 24 hours with information including the date and time. CONASHAUGH NEWS Trash Talk Important Reminder Regarding Associate Gate Cards Associate card holders must use the main entrance to enter the Community via the card access at the main entrance. Associate Gate Cards no longer work at the member only Seneca gate. Please be sure to alert your Associate card holders. Associates may include family members, relatives or others who do not live with you but may visit frequently. Members are permitted up to two Associate Gate cards per household. Use by contractors is not permitted. A vehicle registration must be presented along with a non- refundable fee of 25.00 per card to obtain an Associate card. Associate cards are not to be used to for the purpose of accessing CLCA amenities such as the compactor and recycling. Associate cards observed being used for this purpose will be deactivated permanently and not restored. There is also a risk of a 500.00 fine.

I hope this note finds you and your family healthy and safe. The last time I wrote to the membership, we were entering 2021 with such hope. While not all hope was conquered, 2021 proved to be a better year for Conashaugh Lakes. Government mandates were lifted and made not so stringent. Our staff remained healthy and safe and are back in the office full time. The office still remains closed to the public. Our pool reopened June 18th with a swim at your own risk policy due to a limited supply of certified lifeguards. Thank you to Board Member Kim Decker who has been overseeing pool operations and monitors as a volunteer this season. Several roads are scheduled to be repaired. Road work will include the installation of several permanent speed bumps. The Recreation Committee was able to schedule and pull off a Picnic for the community which was very well attended. They did an awesome job. Final plans for the relocation of the compactors have been approved by the Board. The engineer is currently working with Dingman Township to obtain the needed permits so that we can move forward on the project. There have been a number of delays with this project especially due to the COVID pandemic last year. A large number of lots and properties have sold this year and we would like to welcome all our new members and neighbors. The Community remains in great financial health and one of the main drivers of that result is our members commitment to paying their dues and keeping those payments a priority. Thank you to everyone reading this who did their part and paid dues during these past 11 months. I would like to thank the many volunteers who take the time to keep us great, including my partners on the Board, committee members, Dumpster Day volunteers, the neighbors who walk our streets and pick up after all of us and watch for our pets when they decide to talk an unscheduled walk. Last but not least, we have an awesome CLCA and Security staff that work tirelessly to do their part to keep Conashaugh a highly desirable place to live. Be safe on the roads and I look forward to a great, successful and healthy remainder of the year to everyone. Last but not least, thank you for your support during my past two years as President of the Board of Directors. While my Board term continues, my presidential term comes to a close on October 1, 2021. 911 Signs Every residence is required to have a 911 sign that is clearly visible. 911 signs may be ordered from the Dingman Township Volunteer Fire Department. Applications can be found on the Conashaugh Website. Installation of 911 signs need to be a minimum of five feet from the edge of the road.

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20212022. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September, which this year falls on September 25th. While at the time of this writing the meeting is scheduled to be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall, which is located just south of our Community, if restrictions due to COVID reoccur there will be alternate plans. If the venue is changed an announcement will be made immediately. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Due to continued concerns regarding COVID refreshments will not be served. The proposed 20212022 Budget includes a one 1 percent increase. No matter how you feel about this increase, it is important that all members participate in voting on the budget. Without the memberships participation and a quorum minimum of 10 response there is technically no vote. No vote means no budget and with no budget we cannot operate. So please be sure to vote. In addition to the vote for our budget there are two members running for Board positions. Annette Musano who is an incumbent and Kimberly Decker who is an appointee. Annette has been a Board Member for the past three years and has acted as the Board Liaison for the Rec Committee for the first two of those years. Kimberly was appointed early this year and during her short time has overseen operations at the pool as a volunteer during this summer. All members will receive a ballot in the mail. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts accounts with delinquent dues or other non-paid balances are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you are planning to attend the Annual Meeting you can still mail in your ballot. This way if something comes up and you are unable to attend the meeting at least your vote makes it to the count. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding the items to be voted. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office. Welcome to Conashaugh Lakes! Hello and welcome to our newest members, the Egleston Family from Clarkstown, New York and Dawn and Al Shirvan from Orange County, New York. We wish much happiness in your new homes. If you have recently moved here and would like it announced in our newspaper, please contact the office. CLC ASSOCIATION CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2021 PAGE 4 CLC ASSOCIATION Burning Within the Community All residents wishing to use burn barrels or campfire pits need to contact the office for a permit. It is a free, one-time process. The permit includes procedures to follow to ensure safety. It is important to call Pike County Communications 570296-7700 each time you burn. This is required by Dingman Township. You also need to call Security 570 686-1130. When calling Security, you do not have to speak to a live person. Please leave a message that you are burning which includes your name, time, lot number and 911 address. Calling the Com Center is important because it is a requirement of our township. By doing so you are helping prevent the possibility of a false alarm being responded to in the event that someone sees the fire and believes it to not be a controlled situation and calling 911. Our Township Fire Department consists of volunteers who are stretched thin enough without having to be called to a campfire. When burning please be considerate of your neighbors. There are many homes with open windows or people outside enjoying their own backyards. Never burn garbage, furniture, building materials or caustic materials. Always use a burn barrel or closed campfire ring. Do not burn anything uncontained on the ground. You should be cognizant of the possibility that what you burn into and leave on the ground has a good chance to one day end up in your well. There is no burning of tree stumps and brush without written permission of Conashaugh Lakes. Keep a hose at the site. Most importantly be aware of conditions before you burn and obey all burn bans that may be in effect. You can find out about burn bans by visiting the Dingman Township Fire Department website at http:www.dingmanfire.com Burning20Ban.htm. By following these simple steps you can enjoy your fire while ensuring safety to your home and neighbors. This simple rule also helps first responders by not having them called out to a false alarm. Road Work Ahead Road repairs and paving will take place on the following roads:  Flatbrook Way between Iroquois and Seneca  Sandy Pine between Conashaugh Trail and Hay Road  Hay Road entire road  Seneca Road section tba In addition to road repairs there will be a total of seven speed humps installed, Conashaugh Trail2, Oneida Way 2, Seneca Drive 2 and Overbrook Run 1. The humps purpose is to help slow down traffic. The areas selected for this round of speed humps were those with the highest traffic flows. Placement will be on straightaways away from intersections. Please note that all of the above will be completed with funds from the Roads Reserve and Capital Improvement funds. There is no date set for the work but weather permitting it is anticipated to begin mid-August. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2021 PAGE 5 GOT STUFF?

Call the office at 570-686-4000 if you have any questions. Dont forget to send your CLCA non-commercial Classifieds to clcaloopptd.net The Loop, Where Did it Go? Many of you are probably wondering about the disappearance of the LOOP. Sadly the Loop was shut down by our email provider as a possible source of spam. Reportedly spamming has become so out of hand, more and more of this is occurring with harsher consequences and providers even using third party companies to track and shut down spammers. Without warning we were unable to send out or reply to messages. This went on for two weeks while our tech person researched the issue and came back with the message from our provider to discontinue or face total shut down. It is understood that not everyone is on Social Media. Cost effective, alternative means to get information out to our Members are being explored. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

While our Community and our roads are private that doesnt mean its time for folks to drive however they wish. Speed limits and stop signs are not optional. The same rules of the road apply in Conashaugh as when one is driving outside of the Community including possessing a driver license and operating a registered, insured and inspected vehicle. In the event that you are issued a citation, it is accompanied by instructions to follow. It is very important that you take action as outlined in the instructions within 30 days of the citation. You are not going to be sent reminders that a ticket was issued and the need to take action. Failure to act will result in forfeiting your right to due process a hearing and the fine associated with violation will be billed to your account and will be payable within the next 30 days and it will begin to accumulate interest. Non-payment will also remove an account from a good standing status with removal of amenities including gate cards. If you wish to contest a violation, you must put your request in writing to the office. Please do not come to the office to debate your violation with staff.. Contested violations are referred to the Hearing Committee, a group of volunteers who are not members of nor affiliated with the Board of Directors. Permit Reminder The Design Review Committee meets each third Saturday of the month to review permit submissions for our members. This is a friendly reminder that permits are required from Conashaugh and in many cases Dingman Township before commencing construction on your property. Below is a partial list of work requiring permits. Please contact the office if you are in doubt or have any questions. Project CLCA Permit Township Permit New Home yes yes Treebrush removal yes may need soil and erosion plan Major landscaping yes maybe depending on work Sheds yes always yes for sheds 100 square ft or larger Pools yes yes Decks yes yes Home additions yes yes Driveway paving yes no Roof replacement yes yes Garages yes yes Fences yes maybe depending on location  size Trees and brush play an important role on your property. Removal can impact a number of things starting with water run- off from your property. All of the homes here are serviced by on site wells. Removal of vegetation is one of nine reasons for wells running dry. If precipitation is running off your property maybe your well is being cheated of the needed water for replenishment. If your well runs dry, you will be looking at a bill in excess of ten thousand dollars to drill a new one. Removal of trees and brush can also impact neighboring properties with increased runoff of precipitation to those properties. Another impact Think Twice Before You Cut is to our waterways. If you are on a lake property or in the vicinity of a stream removal of vegetation leads not only to a risk of erosion to your property but runoff of rain into the waterway taking with it any debris and soils in its path. Last but not least, trees and brush provide a habitat and protection to birds and wildlife. As a friendly reminder, the removal of trees and brush from your property and major landscaping projects require an inspection and permit. Some balk at this as a control measure to tell members what they can and cannot do on their properties. It is not and it is for a good reason that restrictions exist for this activity. Failure to obtain a permit can lead to a fine and costly replacement of the removed trees. To obtain a permit, tie off the treesbrush that are desired for removal with a ribbon or tape. Do not spray paint the trees. Contact the office for an inspection and permit.

Help Us Get Them Back to You There have been a number of found dogs in the Community over the past several months. Thanks to social media, help from the Pike County Humane Society, Security Officer Maria Weber and Office Staff all were reunited with their owners. We would like to continue with happy reunions and asking our members to help with this task. First, everyone should be aware that pets, particularly dogs are not allowed to roam. It is understood that some pets are expert escape artists and opportunists. There are number of things you can do to help get your pet returned it should be lost If your pet is a Houdini, please take extra care to keep them from escaping. Make sure gates and doors are secure and children know not to let them run out License your dog. It is the law. Have them wear identification including a collar with a current phone number and tags. If you are expecting visitors with pets it is important that they have their pets wear identification. Provide the office with a photo and information regarding your pet. Include their age, gender and name to keep on record. CLCA does not have a facility to hold found pets. If you decide to capture a roaming dog or cat, please be prepared to hold it until it can be picked up by the owner or the Humane Society. Security and CLCA Staff are not animal handlers and will not pursue or retrieve a dog at large. Members may contact us to report finding a pet by calling the office or security or sending a message by FB Messenger or email. Please note that social media and email are not monitored 247. When reporting a found pet, please include description and contact information. Should you need to call them, the phone number for the Pike County Humane Society is 570-296-7654 and Pike County Dog Warden is 570-350-3589.

The meeting takes place Saturday September 25th, 2021. Included in that packet will be the 20212022 Proposed Budget and the CLCA Reserve schedule. The proposed budget is for a 1  one percent increase. CLCA is among a handful of Communities in the region wherein the membership participates in budget votes. A number of other Communities budgets are decidedvoted by a Board of Directors and then introduced to the Community and billed. The Finance Committee is committed to preparing a detailed, fair budget each year for the Boards review. We have enjoyed two previous fiscal years with zero increases. Increased costs for fuel and power impacted by recent inflation are beginning to be seen. These impacts dont end at our gas pump or electric panel box but affect vendors that provide services. We have been very fortunate and are thankful for our members who continue to make paying dues a priority. This reduces the need for additional costs spent for collections. The Finance Committee would like our Members to have an understanding of our Budget and Reserve Schedules. The following is in an effort to walk you through these two documents and the differences between them. The Budget is for the day to day operation of the community think of it as checkbook for dailymonthly operating expenses and the Reserve schedule is for replacement of large assets such as major building repairs or renovations, trucks and larger equipment replacement think of it as a savings account. Budget: For those of you who may not know this, unlike a number of communities in the area, our members vote on the budget. The CLCA budget is worked on by the Finance Committee. As with all of our Committees, any member in good standing is welcome to attend the meetings. Work on the budget typically begins in June. Averages of actual expenses for the past four years are the starting point to working on the budget. Additional consideration for projected increases or decreases in costs are also looked at and adjusted accordingly. There are two parts to the budget Inflows money in and General Operating expensesmoney out. The totals for each of those sections must be the same. That is a balanced budget. There are lines for inflows including dues. It is important to not confuse Inflows incomemoney in with General Operating Expenses money out. Income: The primary source of income is dues. If you look at the bottom right side of the page for the proposed 20212022 Budget you will note the number of homes, lots and contiguous lots. If you take the number from the Homeowners dues inflow line and divide it by the number of homes your answer is the proposed dues for Homeowners. The same math applies for lots and contiguous lots. Dues discount is a projected amount of money that will reduce dues income as a result of members taking advantage of this payment option. The doubtful account line is the projected amount of money we will not receive from members who fail to pay their dues. This could be for a number of reasons valid and non-valid including but not limited to, foreclosure, bankruptcy, hardship, lack of priorities, abandonment of lots to foreclosure and tax sales. Effort is made whenever legally possible to pursue unpaid dues by the office staff, our attorney and through the legal system. Other Inflowsincome are estimated based on history and projection. Income from resale certificates and transfer fees can fluctuate depending on the home market. Expenses There are three different payroll expense lines, one for the office, one for maintenance and the third payroll is included in the pool supplies and operations. Payroll bonus applies to all permanent employees. Currently there are 9. There are two lines for the Dam. There are two road lines. One is for repair of the roads which can include materials such as stone, culvert pipes, wood for guide rails, signage etc. In addition to the road repair line there is a road reserve line. In the past those funds were utilized to pave dirt roads. Future funds to this account will include major repairs to maintain the roads. Miscellaneous expense can cover a number of expenses. Donations to the Fire Department, Humane Society or additional educational expenses for staff that may be needed and are over and above training budget. Reserves On the reverse side of the Budget is the General Reserve schedule. This lists CLCAs larger owned assets. Nothing lasts forever and will eventually need to be repaired, roofed, sided, windows, septic, well pumps, restored or totally replaced or expanded. These funds are for that purpose. While we have these items insured, maintenance, deterioration and wear and tear are not covered by insurance. Thanks to reserves, Conashaugh is free of loans and interest payments for those loans. Reserves have also deterred the need to charge members for long term additional assessments. Not too many HOAs can say that. The list is reviewed and items no longer owned and or replaced are removed or updated. Funds for removed items that are no longer needed are redistributed to underfunded lines. Replacement costs will fluctuate and be adjusted up and down as needed. It should also be noted that the schedule of listed assets are periodically reviewed and the replacement cost may need to be adjusted up or down. As for the reserve schedule, the first column after the asset description is the original cost for that item. The amounts funded for certain items were questioned in the past. The funded amounts for the individual line items are not set in stone. In other words, if needed or decided those funds can be moved to another item. An example of what is being said here is as follows: Say that a vehicle or piece of equipment failed beyond repair and replacement was necessary. The replacement cost for that item by either or new or used item is 10,000 but the reserve line for that item was only funded for 5,000.00. The additional 5,000.00 could be moved from another item or items to make up the difference to enable the replacement. Hopefully the above will clarify some of the information concerning the proposed budget and reserve schedule. If you have any questions, please contact the office. Thank you. Who You Gonna Call?

On Sunday April 18, many of you took the time to memorialize our sons Mike and Joe. Thank you to the Rec Committee for organizing this beautiful tribute at Conashaugh Lake, to Board Members Bill King and Annette Musano for the kind words and prayer that were shared, my co-workers for the beautiful pictures and the love that went into making the memorial bench for Mike and Joe will never be forgotten. Sincerely Jeanne and Eddie Calabrese CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER2021 PAGE 12 CLCA Annual Picnic The Annual Picnic returned this year in full swing. After COVID squashing any plans for last year, it was time to move forward. The Rec Committee planned, shopped, chopped and prepped for this years picnic all within one months time. The weather forecast was a bit scary to say the least with wind, rain and lightning threatening for Friday night and Saturday. Tents were up and phones lit up with warnings of impending storms that by some wonderful intervention passed around us. The day and weather turned out perfect and no rain was in sight until after the picnic ended. The food was endless and delicious with London broil, chicken wings, pulled pork, prepared by Prime Time Meats of Milford. No picnic would be complete without hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, vegetarian and ethnic options to name a few. There was also a slew of delicious desserts donated by our members. DJ Ralph Cordero provided musical entertainment. It was a great day! This year there were a record number of volunteers. There are so many people to thank for this event starting with Rec Committee members Amanda Dumont chairperson, Marisa Jarasecretary and Linda Henry for all the planning, reserving tents, music and shopping for everything from food to games and needed supplies. Thank you to the grill masters of the day Eddie Calabrese, Patti Havekost, Betty and Jim Buccine. Other worker bees who volunteered and made this day a success include Christine Barnett, Chris Buccine, Barbara, Kenny and Alex Chopyk, Tina Christiansen, Donna Dupree, Celia Egleston, the Moyer family, Mike and Christy Oja, Norma and Ivan Santiago, Elizabeth Torma, David Weed, Amy Weis Weinick and Sally Yearwood. Thank you to our maintenance guys Craig, CJ and Ken for their work preparing the picnic area, delivering supplies, tables, chairs and coming in after the picnic was over to transport items and trash and office staff for handling ticket reservations and advertising.

I hope this note finds you and your family healthy and safe. The last time I wrote to the membership, we were entering 2021 with such hope. While not all hope was conquered, 2021 proved to be a better year for Conashaugh Lakes. Government mandates were lifted and made not so stringent. Our staff remained healthy and safe and are back in the office full time. The office still remains closed to the public. Our pool reopened June 18th with a swim at your own risk policy due to a limited supply of certified lifeguards. Thank you to Board Member Kim Decker who has been overseeing pool operations and monitors as a volunteer this season. Several roads are scheduled to be repaired. Road work will include the installation of several permanent speed bumps. The Recreation Committee was able to schedule and pull off a Picnic for the community which was very well attended. They did an awesome job. Final plans for the relocation of the compactors have been approved by the Board. The engineer is currently working with Dingman Township to obtain the needed permits so that we can move forward on the project. There have been a number of delays with this project especially due to the COVID pandemic last year. A large number of lots and properties have sold this year and we would like to welcome all our new members and neighbors. The Community remains in great financial health and one of the main drivers of that result is our members commitment to paying their dues and keeping those payments a priority. Thank you to everyone reading this who did their part and paid dues during these past 11 months. I would like to thank the many volunteers who take the time to keep us great, including my partners on the Board, committee members, Dumpster Day volunteers, the neighbors who walk our streets and pick up after all of us and watch for our pets when they decide to talk an unscheduled walk. Last but not least, we have an awesome CLCA and Security staff that work tirelessly to do their part to keep Conashaugh a highly desirable place to live. Be safe on the roads and I look forward to a great, successful and healthy remainder of the year to everyone. Last but not least, thank you for your support during my past two years as President of the Board of Directors. While my Board term continues, my presidential term comes to a close on October 1, 2021. 911 Signs Every residence is required to have a 911 sign that is clearly visible. 911 signs may be ordered from the Dingman Township Volunteer Fire Department. Applications can be found on the Conashaugh Website. Installation of 911 signs need to be a minimum of five feet from the edge of the road.",

CLCA Annual Meeting Welcome to the AnnualSummer Edition of the Conashaugh Lakes Courier. It is one of two Courier publications issued each year. In addition to general articles, this edition includes information regarding the proposed budget for 20212022. The Annual Meeting takes place on the last Saturday of September, which this year falls on September 25th. While at the time of this writing the meeting is scheduled to be held at St. Vincents Parish Hall, which is located just south of our Community, if restrictions due to COVID reoccur there will be alternate plans. If the venue is changed an announcement will be made immediately. Start time for the meeting is 9:00 a.m. Due to continued concerns regarding COVID refreshments will not be served. The proposed 20212022 Budget includes a one 1 percent increase. No matter how you feel about this increase, it is important that all members participate in voting on the budget. Without the memberships participation and a quorum minimum of 10 response there is technically no vote. No vote means no budget and with no budget we cannot operate. So please be sure to vote. In addition to the vote for our budget there are two members running for Board positions. Annette Musano who is an incumbent and Kimberly Decker who is an appointee. Annette has been a Board Member for the past three years and has acted as the Board Liaison for the Rec Committee for the first two of those years. Kimberly was appointed early this year and during her short time has overseen operations at the pool as a volunteer during this summer. All members will receive a ballot in the mail. Owners are permitted only one vote regardless of the number of people on a deed or properties owned by that party. For example if two people together own five properties, they are only eligible for one vote. If you do not receive a ballot in the mail by August 30th, Please contact or visit the CLCA office. Votes can be cast by mail to Beck, Gogolski and Poska by using the provided envelope or in person on the day of the Annual Meeting. If you vote by mail please do not include dues payments or other correspondence with your ballot. Do not mail or deliver your ballot to the CLCA Office. We cannot accept them. If you prefer to vote in person at the meeting you will be provided a ballot upon sign in. Members with delinquent accounts accounts with delinquent dues or other non-paid balances are members not in good standing. Please note that only votes from members in good standing will be counted CLCA recognizes proxies for the Annual Meeting. A proxy is a written authorization empowering another person to vote or act for the signer. Included on your ballot is a section to assign a proxy. This gives members the opportunity to continue to vote beyond the initial mailed ballot. If additional voting is necessary at the meeting and you are not present or have not assigned a proxy your voting power ends after your initial, mailed in vote. An example of where additional voting would be required is in the event of a failed or tied budget vote. If you are planning to attend the Annual Meeting you can still mail in your ballot. This way if something comes up and you are unable to attend the meeting at least your vote makes it to the count. If you assign a proxy on your ballot, it is important to be familiar with that persons position and visa-versa regarding the items to be voted. The proxy assigned by you is not informed as to how you voted on your mailed in ballot and, without knowing your position will likely use your proxy to vote their own conscience. Please note that mail-in deadlines and eligibility to vote are strictly followed. If you have any questions regarding ballots, proxies or the Annual Meeting, please do not hesitate to contact the CLCA Office. Welcome to Conashaugh Lakes! Hello and welcome to our newest members, the Egleston Family from Clarkstown, New York and Dawn and Al Shirvan from Orange County, New York. We wish much happiness in your new homes. If you have recently moved here and would like it announced in our newspaper, please contact the office. CLC ASSOCIATION",

It is a free, one-time process. The permit includes procedures to follow to ensure safety. It is important to call Pike County Communications 570296-7700 each time you burn. This is required by Dingman Township. You also need to call Security 570 686-1130. When calling Security, you do not have to speak to a live person. Please leave a message that you are burning which includes your name, time, lot number and 911 address. Calling the Com Center is important because it is a requirement of our township. By doing so you are helping prevent the possibility of a false alarm being responded to in the event that someone sees the fire and believes it to not be a controlled situation and calling 911. Our Township Fire Department consists of volunteers who are stretched thin enough without having to be called to a campfire. When burning please be considerate of your neighbors. There are many homes with open windows or people outside enjoying their own backyards. Never burn garbage, furniture, building materials or caustic materials. Always use a burn barrel or closed campfire ring. Do not burn anything uncontained on the ground. You should be cognizant of the possibility that what you burn into and leave on the ground has a good chance to one day end up in your well. There is no burning of tree stumps and brush without written permission of Conashaugh Lakes. Keep a hose at the site. Most importantly be aware of conditions before you burn and obey all burn bans that may be in effect. You can find out about burn bans by visiting the Dingman Township Fire Department website at http:www.dingmanfire.com Burning20Ban.htm. By following these simple steps you can enjoy your fire while ensuring safety to your home and neighbors. This simple rule also helps first responders by not having them called out to a false alarm. Road Work Ahead Road repairs and paving will take place on the following roads:  Flatbrook Way between Iroquois and Seneca  Sandy Pine between Conashaugh Trail and Hay Road  Hay Road entire road  Seneca Road section tba In addition to road repairs there will be a total of seven speed humps installed, Conashaugh Trail2, Oneida Way 2, Seneca Drive 2 and Overbrook Run 1. The humps purpose is to help slow down traffic. The areas selected for this round of speed humps were those with the highest traffic flows. Placement will be on straightaways away from intersections. Please note that all of the above will be completed with funds from the Roads Reserve and Capital Improvement funds. There is no date set for the work but weather permitting it is anticipated to begin mid-August.",

Many of you are probably wondering about the disappearance of the LOOP. Sadly the Loop was shut down by our email provider as a possible source of spam. Reportedly spamming has become so out of hand, more and more of this is occurring with harsher consequences and providers even using third party companies to track and shut down spammers. Without warning we were unable to send out or reply to messages. This went on for two weeks while our tech person researched the issue and came back with the message from our provider to discontinue or face total shut down. It is understood that not everyone is on Social Media. Cost effective, alternative means to get information out to our Members are being explored. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

While our Community and our roads are private that doesnt mean its time for folks to drive however they wish. Speed limits and stop signs are not optional. The same rules of the road apply in Conashaugh as when one is driving outside of the Community including possessing a driver license and operating a registered, insured and inspected vehicle. In the event that you are issued a citation, it is accompanied by instructions to follow. It is very important that you take action as outlined in the instructions within 30 days of the citation. You are not going to be sent reminders that a ticket was issued and the need to take action. Failure to act will result in forfeiting your right to due process a hearing and the fine associated with violation will be billed to your account and will be payable within the next 30 days and it will begin to accumulate interest. Non-payment will also remove an account from a good standing status with removal of amenities including gate cards. If you wish to contest a violation, you must put your request in writing to the office. Please do not come to the office to debate your violation with staff.. Contested violations are referred to the Hearing Committee, a group of volunteers who are not members of nor affiliated with the Board of Directors. Permit Reminder The Design Review Committee meets each third Saturday of the month to review permit submissions for our members. This is a friendly reminder that permits are required from Conashaugh and in many cases Dingman Township before commencing construction on your property. Below is a partial list of work requiring permits. Please contact the office if you are in doubt or have any questions. Project CLCA Permit Township Permit New Home yes yes Treebrush removal yes may need soil and erosion plan Major landscaping yes maybe depending on work Sheds yes always yes for sheds 100 square ft or larger Pools yes yes Decks yes yes Home additions yes yes Driveway paving yes no Roof replacement yes yes Garages yes yes Fences yes maybe depending on location  size Trees and brush play an important role on your property. Removal can impact a number of things starting with water run- off from your property. All of the homes here are serviced by on site wells. Removal of vegetation is one of nine reasons for wells running dry. If precipitation is running off your property maybe your well is being cheated of the needed water for replenishment. If your well runs dry, you will be looking at a bill in excess of ten thousand dollars to drill a new one. Removal of trees and brush can also impact neighboring properties with increased runoff of precipitation to those properties. Another impact Think Twice Before You Cut is to our waterways. If you are on a lake property or in the vicinity of a stream removal of vegetation leads not only to a risk of erosion to your property but runoff of rain into the waterway taking with it any debris and soils in its path. Last but not least, trees and brush provide a habitat and protection to birds and wildlife. As a friendly reminder, the removal of trees and brush from your property and major landscaping projects require an inspection and permit. Some balk at this as a control measure to tell members what they can and cannot do on their properties. It is not and it is for a good reason that restrictions exist for this activity. Failure to obtain a permit can lead to a fine and costly replacement of the removed trees. To obtain a permit, tie off the treesbrush that are desired for removal with a ribbon or tape. Do not spray paint the trees. Contact the office for an inspection and permit.",

Help Us Get Them Back to You There have been a number of found dogs in the Community over the past several months. Thanks to social media, help from the Pike County Humane Society, Security Officer Maria Weber and Office Staff all were reunited with their owners. We would like to continue with happy reunions and asking our members to help with this task. First, everyone should be aware that pets, particularly dogs are not allowed to roam. It is understood that some pets are expert escape artists and opportunists. There are number of things you can do to help get your pet returned it should be lost If your pet is a Houdini, please take extra care to keep them from escaping. Make sure gates and doors are secure and children know not to let them run out License your dog. It is the law. Have them wear identification including a collar with a current phone number and tags. If you are expecting visitors with pets it is important that they have their pets wear identification. Provide the office with a photo and information regarding your pet. Include their age, gender and name to keep on record. CLCA does not have a facility to hold found pets. If you decide to capture a roaming dog or cat, please be prepared to hold it until it can be picked up by the owner or the Humane Society. Security and CLCA Staff are not animal handlers and will not pursue or retrieve a dog at large. Members may contact us to report finding a pet by calling the office or security or sending a message by FB Messenger or email. Please note that social media and email are not monitored 247. When reporting a found pet, please include description and contact information. Should you need to call them, the phone number for the Pike County Humane Society is 570-296-7654 and Pike County Dog Warden is 570-350-3589. The Pike County Treasurers Office maintains a database of dog licenses that are issued. Their number is 570-296-3441.",

The proposed budget is for a 1  one percent increase. CLCA is among a handful of Communities in the region wherein the membership participates in budget votes. A number of other Communities budgets are decidedvoted by a Board of Directors and then introduced to the Community and billed. The Finance Committee is committed to preparing a detailed, fair budget each year for the Boards review. We have enjoyed two previous fiscal years with zero increases. Increased costs for fuel and power impacted by recent inflation are beginning to be seen. These impacts dont end at our gas pump or electric panel box but affect vendors that provide services. We have been very fortunate and are thankful for our members who continue to make paying dues a priority. This reduces the need for additional costs spent for collections. The Finance Committee would like our Members to have an understanding of our Budget and Reserve Schedules. The following is in an effort to walk you through these two documents and the differences between them. The Budget is for the day to day operation of the community think of it as checkbook for dailymonthly operating expenses and the Reserve schedule is for replacement of large assets such as major building repairs or renovations, trucks and larger equipment replacement think of it as a savings account. Budget: For those of you who may not know this, unlike a number of communities in the area, our members vote on the budget. The CLCA budget is worked on by the Finance Committee. As with all of our Committees, any member in good standing is welcome to attend the meetings. Work on the budget typically begins in June. Averages of actual expenses for the past four years are the starting point to working on the budget. Additional consideration for projected increases or decreases in costs are also looked at and adjusted accordingly. There are two parts to the budget Inflows money in and General Operating expensesmoney out. The totals for each of those sections must be the same. That is a balanced budget. There are lines for inflows including dues. It is important to not confuse Inflows incomemoney in with General Operating Expenses money out. Income: The primary source of income is dues. If you look at the bottom right side of the page for the proposed 20212022 Budget you will note the number of homes, lots and contiguous lots. If you take the number from the Homeowners dues inflow line and divide it by the number of homes your answer is the proposed dues for Homeowners. The same math applies for lots and contiguous lots. Dues discount is a projected amount of money that will reduce dues income as a result of members taking advantage of this payment option. The doubtful account line is the projected amount of money we will not receive from members who fail to pay their dues. This could be for a number of reasons valid and non-valid including but not limited to, foreclosure, bankruptcy, hardship, lack of priorities, abandonment of lots to foreclosure and tax sales. Effort is made whenever legally possible to pursue unpaid dues by the office staff, our attorney and through the legal system. Other Inflowsincome are estimated based on history and projection. Income from resale certificates and transfer fees can fluctuate depending on the home market. Expenses There are three different payroll expense lines, one for the office, one for maintenance and the third payroll is included in the pool supplies and operations. Payroll bonus applies to all permanent employees. Currently there are 9. There are two lines for the Dam. There are two road lines. One is for repair of the roads which can include materials such as stone, culvert pipes, wood for guide rails, signage etc. In addition to the road repair line there is a road reserve line. In the past those funds were utilized to pave dirt roads. Future funds to this account will include major repairs to maintain the roads. Miscellaneous expense can cover a number of expenses. Donations to the Fire Department, Humane Society or additional educational expenses for staff that may be needed and are over and above training budget. Reserves On the reverse side of the Budget is the General Reserve schedule. This lists CLCAs larger owned assets. Nothing lasts forever and will eventually need to be repaired, roofed, sided, windows, septic, well pumps, restored or totally replaced or expanded. These funds are for that purpose. While we have these items insured, maintenance, deterioration and wear and tear are not covered by insurance. Thanks to reserves, Conashaugh is free of loans and interest payments for those loans. Reserves have also deterred the need to charge members for long term additional assessments. Not too many HOAs can say that. The list is reviewed and items no longer owned and or replaced are removed or updated. Funds for removed items that are no longer needed are redistributed to underfunded lines. Replacement costs will fluctuate and be adjusted up and down as needed. It should also be noted that the schedule of listed assets are periodically reviewed and the replacement cost may need to be adjusted up or down. As for the reserve schedule, the first column after the asset description is the original cost for that item. The amounts funded for certain items were questioned in the past. The funded amounts for the individual line items are not set in stone. In other words, if needed or decided those funds can be moved to another item. An example of what is being said here is as follows: Say that a vehicle or piece of equipment failed beyond repair and replacement was necessary. The replacement cost for that item by either or new or used item is 10,000 but the reserve line for that item was only funded for 5,000.00. The additional 5,000.00 could be moved from another item or items to make up the difference to enable the replacement. Hopefully the above will clarify some of the information concerning the proposed budget and reserve schedule. If you have any questions, please contact the office. Thank you. Who You Gonna Call?

After COVID squashing any plans for last year, it was time to move forward. The Rec Committee planned, shopped, chopped and prepped for this years picnic all within one months time. The weather forecast was a bit scary to say the least with wind, rain and lightning threatening for Friday night and Saturday. Tents were up and phones lit up with warnings of impending storms that by some wonderful intervention passed around us. The day and weather turned out perfect and no rain was in sight until after the picnic ended. The food was endless and delicious with London broil, chicken wings, pulled pork, prepared by Prime Time Meats of Milford. No picnic would be complete without hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, vegetarian and ethnic options to name a few. There was also a slew of delicious desserts donated by our members. DJ Ralph Cordero provided musical entertainment. It was a great day! This year there were a record number of volunteers. There are so many people to thank for this event starting with Rec Committee members Amanda Dumont chairperson, Marisa Jarasecretary and Linda Henry for all the planning, reserving tents, music and shopping for everything from food to games and needed supplies. Thank you to the grill masters of the day Eddie Calabrese, Patti Havekost, Betty and Jim Buccine. Other worker bees who volunteered and made this day a success include Christine Barnett, Chris Buccine, Barbara, Kenny and Alex Chopyk, Tina Christiansen, Donna Dupree, Celia Egleston, the Moyer family, Mike and Christy Oja, Norma and Ivan Santiago, Elizabeth Torma, David Weed, Amy Weis Weinick and Sally Yearwood. Thank you to our maintenance guys Craig, CJ and Ken for their work preparing the picnic area, delivering supplies, tables, chairs and coming in after the picnic was over to transport items and trash and office staff for handling ticket reservations and advertising.",

I hope this note finds you and your family healthy and safe. The last time I wrote to the membership, we were entering 2020 with such hope. While not all hope was conquered, 2020 proved to be a year full of challenges thanks to COVID-19. Government mandates impacted a lot of our lives, some worse than others. Despite the challenges our Community faced we were able to continue operating and made strides. Our staff remained healthy and safe due to taking the proper workplace precautions. Although a number of local communities decided to forego opening some or most of their amenities, plans and actions were taken here to open our pool and other amenities with the exception of the lake for swimming. New roads were paved, our tennis and basketball court surface was repaired, the Recreation Committee came up with some awesome ideas to get everyone through the holidays and our maintenance and office staff continued doing what they always do best. Covid restrictions outside of our area resulted in many people relocating to the Poconos. Homes in our area and this Community are selling quickly. We welcome our new members and neighbors. Demand for properties is also on the rise. Something that COVID did not impact is our Communitys good financial health and one of the main drivers of that result is our members commitment to paying their dues and keeping those payments a priority. Thank you to everyone reading this who did their part and paid dues during these past 11 months. I would like to thank the many volunteers who take the time to keep us great, including my partners on the Board, Committee members, Dumpster Day volunteers, the neighbors who walk our streets and pick up after all of us and watch for our pets when they decide to talk an unscheduled walk. Last but not least, we have an awesome CLCA and Security staff that work tirelessly to do their part to keep Conashaugh a highly desirable place to live. Patti Havekost CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2021 PAGE 3 CLCASSOCIATION 2020- 2021 Board Mtgs The following is a list of Board Meetings scheduled for the remainder of the 20-21 CLCA fiscal year. Meeting start time is 10:30 a.m. Due to COVID mandates, we are currently restricted with the number of attendees at meeting. Until further notice there will be a limit of 20 people permitted at the meetings, including Board Members. Any changes in our countys COVID phase status will result in changes for meetings. If you are interested to attend a Board Meeting, please send your name and reservation request to administrator conashaughlakes.com by the Thursday preceding the meeting date. March 13th April 10th May 8th June 12th July 10th August 14th September 25th Annual Meeting- There is no additional Membership Meeting held in September. CLCA Income Statements In response to a question posed at the Members Meeting in September regarding the budgetary and actual income statement performance, please find the Treasurers response below. It is important to first note and understand that the development of the annual budget is only a forecast of what the community will collect in dues and spend in cash and will need in reserves for future liabilities. It is drafted by the collective effort of the finance committee and office staff. It is subsequently reviewed by the board and after all board members concerns have been addressed, passed by the board. After board passage it is presented at the annual members meeting for approval by the membership. It is not until it is passed by the members that we have a budget  plan for the calendar year. The budget is developed by at the four year run rate by department and modified by expenditure increases and decreases that we forecast may occur for the upcoming year. Bottom line is that its an estimate at best. During the year the finance committee and the board review how we are performing to budget and make appropriate adjustments to insure that the total expenditures do not exceed the total budget. This may require deferring certain expenditures in a fiscal year to pay for unanticipated surprise expenses. Such as a few years ago we had heavier than normal snows requiring more snow removal and associated over time, plow gas, road treatment, etc., hence expenses. Any surplus funds at year-end are put in reserve toward future replacement or project projects or equipment in accordance with the PA Act 180 regs. Our expenses over the past four years has been: Total Largest Exp Items 2017 844,170 191,284 Roads 2018 847,432 123,371 PoolRec Bldg 2019 1,075,636 360,463 Roads 2020 843,159 183,234 Roads  Note: includes 2018 and 2019 road paving. 2018 billing not received or paid until October 2019.  Note: Pool repair and Rec Building paid from reserves Road paving has been the single largest expense, almost  of the annual budget over recent years. Expenditures have remained relatively constant over the past four years, adjusting for the 2018 road paving being paid in 2019, and the repairs to the pool and renovation of the club house. The board has made a conscientious effort to hold dues as best as it can. As I stated at the members meeting, our maintenance and office staff have done a superior job in managing the community to its budget! If we had to outsource these services, I am confident that we would not have the same level of responsiveness and all of our dues would increase exponentially. The Finance Committee encourages you to attend our meeting which is held the Thursday before every Board Meeting at 7PM in the Recreation Building. Where we have more in depth discussions. For which we do respectfully request that you sign a Confidentiality Agreement. We do not want non-members understanding the extent of the communitys finances, especially given the extent of cyber thieves activity these days. Bill King Treasurer CLCA Board of Directors Thank You! We would like to thank all the volunteers of our Recreation Committee who made it possible for Santa Claus to come to town. We all know that Santa Claus lives in the North Pole, however, we think December 19, 2020 in Conashaugh Lakes it was even colder than the North Pole. Anyone who wishes to be a part of the Recreation Committee is welcome. They meet on the third Saturday of each month, 10 am at the Rec Building. The deadline to submit Board of Director applications for the 20212022 Fiscal year is Monday May 2, 2021. Elections will be held during the September Annual Meeting on Saturday September 25,2021. If you are interested in running for a position on the Board, please submit your application and any required documents by the deadline. Criteria for Board Applicants can be found in the CLCA By-Laws. Thank you. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2021 PAGE 4 CLCA NEWS Do I Need a Permit?

Important Information, Please Read Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are in our future. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, we have a lot of new members who may not be as familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. What is a road ban? It is a period of time when vehicles exceeding 10,000 lbs are prohibited entry in the Community. How long do they last? These bans are to protect our roads from damage during thaw periods. We are permitted a total of eight weeks for the bans. As of this writing we have experienced colder temperatures although not consistently. Whether a ban will take place is determined by weather conditions. We still have February and March to watch conditions. There are no set dates for bans. Road and weather conditions are checked weekly by maintenance and may be intermittent. Road bans are limited to eight weeks and may be lifted and reinstated. They are totally weather driven. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP, our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes and website, www.conashaughlakes.com. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they were not aware or forgot about bans. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company, USPS, UPS, and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation. CLCA NEWS CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2021 PAGE 6 Dumpster Day a Great Success!

The find was reported to the PA department of Agriculture and acknowledged by them. Alerts were posted on our Facebook page and sent over the LOOP. Our website has had a long running alert regarding this insect. The alert includes photos of the different stages of this bad bug. If anyone finds one of these insects, it needs to be killed immediately and placed in a ziplock lunch bag with alcohol and keep the specimen for the Department of Agriculture. It is very important that the event be reported to the department of agriculture who will contact reporters and request the specimen. They have an entomologist who will dissect the specimen to determine its origin. The following link can be used to report Lantern Flies https:www.agriculture.pa.govPlants_Land_WaterPlantIndustryEntomology spotted_lanternflySpottedLanternflyAlertPagesdefault.aspx.

I hope this note finds you and your family healthy and safe. The last time I wrote to the membership, we were entering 2020 with such hope. While not all hope was conquered, 2020 proved to be a year full of challenges thanks to COVID-19. Government mandates impacted a lot of our lives, some worse than others. Despite the challenges our Community faced we were able to continue operating and made strides. Our staff remained healthy and safe due to taking the proper workplace precautions. Although a number of local communities decided to forego opening some or most of their amenities, plans and actions were taken here to open our pool and other amenities with the exception of the lake for swimming. New roads were paved, our tennis and basketball court surface was repaired, the Recreation Committee came up with some awesome ideas to get everyone through the holidays and our maintenance and office staff continued doing what they always do best. Covid restrictions outside of our area resulted in many people relocating to the Poconos. Homes in our area and this Community are selling quickly. We welcome our new members and neighbors. Demand for properties is also on the rise. Something that COVID did not impact is our Communitys good financial health and one of the main drivers of that result is our members commitment to paying their dues and keeping those payments a priority. Thank you to everyone reading this who did their part and paid dues during these past 11 months. I would like to thank the many volunteers who take the time to keep us great, including my partners on the Board, Committee members, Dumpster Day volunteers, the neighbors who walk our streets and pick up after all of us and watch for our pets when they decide to talk an unscheduled walk. Last but not least, we have an awesome CLCA and Security staff that work tirelessly to do their part to keep Conashaugh a highly desirable place to live. Patti Havekost",

Meeting start time is 10:30 a.m. Due to COVID mandates, we are currently restricted with the number of attendees at meeting. Until further notice there will be a limit of 20 people permitted at the meetings, including Board Members. Any changes in our countys COVID phase status will result in changes for meetings. If you are interested to attend a Board Meeting, please send your name and reservation request to administrator conashaughlakes.com by the Thursday preceding the meeting date. March 13th April 10th May 8th June 12th July 10th August 14th September 25th Annual Meeting- There is no additional Membership Meeting held in September. CLCA Income Statements In response to a question posed at the Members Meeting in September regarding the budgetary and actual income statement performance, please find the Treasurers response below. It is important to first note and understand that the development of the annual budget is only a forecast of what the community will collect in dues and spend in cash and will need in reserves for future liabilities. It is drafted by the collective effort of the finance committee and office staff. It is subsequently reviewed by the board and after all board members concerns have been addressed, passed by the board. After board passage it is presented at the annual members meeting for approval by the membership. It is not until it is passed by the members that we have a budget  plan for the calendar year. The budget is developed by at the four year run rate by department and modified by expenditure increases and decreases that we forecast may occur for the upcoming year. Bottom line is that its an estimate at best. During the year the finance committee and the board review how we are performing to budget and make appropriate adjustments to insure that the total expenditures do not exceed the total budget. This may require deferring certain expenditures in a fiscal year to pay for unanticipated surprise expenses. Such as a few years ago we had heavier than normal snows requiring more snow removal and associated over time, plow gas, road treatment, etc., hence expenses. Any surplus funds at year-end are put in reserve toward future replacement or project projects or equipment in accordance with the PA Act 180 regs. Our expenses over the past four years has been: Total Largest Exp Items 2017 844,170 191,284 Roads 2018 847,432 123,371 PoolRec Bldg 2019 1,075,636 360,463 Roads 2020 843,159 183,234 Roads  Note: includes 2018 and 2019 road paving. 2018 billing not received or paid until October 2019.  Note: Pool repair and Rec Building paid from reserves Road paving has been the single largest expense, almost  of the annual budget over recent years. Expenditures have remained relatively constant over the past four years, adjusting for the 2018 road paving being paid in 2019, and the repairs to the pool and renovation of the club house. The board has made a conscientious effort to hold dues as best as it can. As I stated at the members meeting, our maintenance and office staff have done a superior job in managing the community to its budget! If we had to outsource these services, I am confident that we would not have the same level of responsiveness and all of our dues would increase exponentially. The Finance Committee encourages you to attend our meeting which is held the Thursday before every Board Meeting at 7PM in the Recreation Building. Where we have more in depth discussions. For which we do respectfully request that you sign a Confidentiality Agreement. We do not want non-members understanding the extent of the communitys finances, especially given the extent of cyber thieves activity these days. Bill King Treasurer CLCA Board of Directors Thank You! We would like to thank all the volunteers of our Recreation Committee who made it possible for Santa Claus to come to town. We all know that Santa Claus lives in the North Pole, however, we think December 19, 2020 in Conashaugh Lakes it was even colder than the North Pole. Anyone who wishes to be a part of the Recreation Committee is welcome. They meet on the third Saturday of each month, 10 am at the Rec Building. The deadline to submit Board of Director applications for the 20212022 Fiscal year is Monday May 2, 2021. Elections will be held during the September Annual Meeting on Saturday September 25,2021.

As a reminder, the Salvation is unable to accept baby equipment including but not limited to car seats, strollers, high chairs and cribs. They also do not accept particle board build yourself furniture as it does not transport well and is susceptible to damage rendering it useless.

Other Communities are welcome to contact the Salvation Army and arrange collections for their members. Best Wishes to Pete and Alex Denigris It was with a mix of much gratitude, many good wishes and some sadness that we bid farewell to Pete and Alex Denigris who will be closed on the sale of their home here in January. Pete and Alex along with their four children Danielle, Marissa, Samantha and Brandon moved to Conashaugh Lakes is 2006. Many of you will recognize Pete as the friendly face you see at our compactor area and working the bus runs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings. He has worked other jobs here since 2016 including maintaining the pool rooms, guard house and Rec Building. Alex led many successful events as a volunteer for the Rec Committee. As sad as it is too see you leave, we wish you and your family much happiness and peace in your new home. Thank you both for all that youve done. Happy Trails! CLCA NEWS",

A special thank you to all our members, volunteers, and dedicated staff who together keep our community running and beautiful. Much appreciation to all the committee members and Board members who volunteer their time to assure our community is moving in the right direction. Together we can accomplish great things. And I look forward to this coming year. Many Blessings to all. Burning Within the Community All residents wishing to use burn barrels or campfire pits need to contact the office for a permit. It is a free, one-time process. The permit includes procedures to follow to ensure safety. It is important to call Pike County Communications 570296-7700 each time you burn. This is required by Dingman Township. You also need to call Security 570 832-5660 and inform the officer or leave a message that you are burning which includes your name, time, lot number and 911 address. By doing so you are helping prevent the possibility of a false alarm being responded to in the event that someone sees the fire and believes it to not be a controlled situation and calling 911. Our Township Fire Department consists of volunteers who are stretched thin enough without having to be called to a campfire. When burning please be considerate of your neighbors. There are many homes with open windows or people outside enjoying their own backyards. Never burn garbage, furniture, building materials or caustic materials. Always use a burn barrel or closed campfire ring. Do not burn anything uncontained on the ground. You should be cognizant of the possibility that what you burn into and leave on the ground has a good chance to one day end up in your well. There is no burning of tree stumps and brush without written permission of Conashaugh Lakes. Keep a hose at the site. Most importantly be aware of conditions before you burn and obey all burn bans that may be in effect. You can find out about burn bans by visiting the Dingman Township Fire Department website at http:www.dingmanfire.comBurning20Ban.htm. By following these simple steps you can enjoy your fire while ensuring safety to your home and neighbors. This simple rule also helps first responders by not having them called out to a false alarm. How to Obtain an Amenity Badge Amenity badges are available through the office. If you do not have an amenity badge, please do the following: Send an email to adminassistantconashaughlakes.com. Please Include with your email Deeded owners names Lot number Individual photos of immediate family members within your household  name of person in the photo no group photos please For children under 18, please provide childs date of birth Once the badge is printed, you will be contacted to arrange pick up.

I look forward to continuing my service to this Community and doing my part for it to remain a safe, clean and great place to live without too many restrictions or unnecessary expense. Marisa Jara Hello Conashaugh Lakes members. My name is Marisa Jara, and my family and I have lived here for three years. I have taught in NY elementary schools for many years, and I have also operated my own childcare facility. We moved from New York, and I have to say it is different here and we are enjoying it. The surrounding trees and wildlife, and the quiet stillness is amazing. Shortly after we moved here the pandemic happened, and it was difficult to do things and meet people. I decided to join a committee; and since I love to entertain and plan fun activities for children I joined Recreation. I have met many delightful people, and together we have planned some activities for the community; the most popular one being the annual picnic. Through my work with Recreation, I was appointed to the Board in 2021, and have been serving as Board Secretary since October. I have enjoyed my time serving and including my thoughts and perspective to the Board discussions. I hope to continue meeting our residents at Recreation events and being a beneficial part of this community for the years to come. Rich Schlosser My name is Rich Schlosser. My wife Alice and I have lived in Conashaugh Lakes for 4 years now after raising our family on Long Island. Before retiring, I worked in the auto service industry for 45 years, with the Last 20 years in shop and store management. On Long Island I have volunteered with the Boy Scouts on the troop level when our sons were involved and then onto District and Council level as chairman of the Advancement Committee, helping scouts achieve the Eagle Rank by approving projects and Eagle board of reviews. I also volunteered at Island Harvest food bank, where I supervised corporate groups with sorting and distributing donated food. In Conashaugh, I have been active with the Security Committee as a member and as committee chairman. After being appointed to an open Board position, I serve as the Liaison to the Maintenance committee and was also asked fill the position of Vice President. I would like to use my past experiences, to continue to make Conashaugh Lakes a great place to live. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2022 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION Homeowners Association committees are a necessity for communities. Among the many benefits, they can provide valuable assistance to the Board of Directors and increase homeowner engagement. HOA board members are homeowners who volunteer to serve their community. As such, board members may not have enough time to take care of every aspect of the community with work, family, and other personal obligations. By having HOA standing committees, board members can delegate some of the tasks and responsibilities to volunteer homeowners. HOA standing committees can take care of the more basic tasks and make recommendations to the board while board members can focus on bigger HOA duties -- such as preparing financial reports, taking care of HOA funds, and planning capital improvement projects. With HOA boards and standing committees working together, the community will be able to function properly and seamlessly. One of the benefits of HOA standing committees is the ability of the board to draw upon the skills and talents of homeowners. It is important for residents to become involved in community matters. This enables residents to appreciate the importance of certain issues such as maintaining property values and resident safety. Since committee membership can change over time, many residents can participate in HOA communities. Joining HOA standing committees not only fosters community engagement but also helps the HOA board accomplish important community tasks. Please consider participating in one or two of Conashaugh Lakes Community Association Standing Committees contributing your talents and areas of expertise to the Community. Our Association Standing Committees and what they do: 1. Design Review Committee - to set architectural and building standards in the Community, supervise the review and approval of all building plans for homes in the Community. 2. Strategic Planning and Resources Committee - to study and recommend plans for long term growth of the Community. 3. Finance Committee - to prepare the annual budget, to review the annual audit, investigate all matters affecting the budget items and direct the investment and insurance program of the Association. 4.

Recreational Committee - to develop programs of social, athletic, and recreational activities and direct the carrying out of any such programs. 6. Maintenance Committee - to maintain and supervise the amenities of the Community to assure they remain in good repair.

For Township information visit their website at www.dingmantownship.org Help Us Get Them Back to You Despite best efforts and diligence, some of our furry friends get away from their owners. Thanks to social media, help from the Pike County Humane Society, Security and office staff many of these pets are reunited with their families. We would like to continue with happy reunions and ask our members to help with this task. First, everyone should be aware that pets, particularly dogs are not allowed to roam. It is understood that some pets are expert escape artists and opportunists. There are number of things you can do to help get your pet returned it should be lost. 1. If your pet is a Houdini, please take extra care to keep them from escaping. Make sure gates and doors are secure and children know not to let them run out. 2. License your dog. It is the law. 3. Have them wear identification including a collar with a current phone number and tags. If you are expecting visitors with pets it is important that they have their pets wear identification. 4. Provide the office with a photo and information regarding your pet. Include their age, gender and name to keep on record. CLCA does not have a facility to hold found pets. If you decide to capture a roaming dog or cat, please be prepared to hold it until it can be picked up by the owner or the Humane Society. Security and CLCA Staff are not animal handlers and will not pursue or retrieve a dog at large. Members may contact us to report finding a pet by calling the office or security or sending a message by FB Messenger or email. Please note that social media and email are not monitored 247. When reporting a found pet, please include description and contact information. Should you need to call them, the phone number for the Pike County Humane Society is 570-296-7654 and Pike County Dog Warden is 570-350-3589. The Pike County Treasurers Office maintains a database of dog licenses that are issued. Their number is 570-296-3441. CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2022 PAGE 7 CLC ASSOCIATION All Members will be receiving a packet in the mail which contains information regarding the CLCA Annual Meeting. This years meeting takes place Saturday September 24th, 2022. Included in the packet will be the 20222023 Proposed Budget and the CLCA Reserve schedule. At the time of this article the current U.S. inflation rate is 9.06. The state of the economy weighs on all of us. Increased costs for fuel and power impacted by inflation continue to be seen. These impacts dont end at our gas pump or electric panel box but affect vendors that provide services and materials for us to operate. The Finance Committee is committed to preparing a detailed, fair budget each year and worked diligently to bring a proposed budget which includes a 2  two percent increase for the 20222023 fiscal year for homes and contiguous lots. Lots that are not developed have a zero proposed increase. The Committee would like our Members to have an understanding of our Budget and Reserve Schedules. The following is in an effort to walk you through these two documents and the differences between them. The Budget is for the day to day operation of the community think of it as checkbook for dailymonthly operating expenses and the Reserve schedule is for replacement of large assets such as major building repairs or renovations, trucks and larger equipment replacement think of it as a savings account. BUDGET For those of you who may not know this, unlike a number of communities in the area, our members vote on the budget. The CLCA budget is worked on by the Finance Committee. As with all of our Committees, any member in good standing is welcome to attend the meetings. Work on the budget typically begins in June. Averages of actual expenses for the past three years are the starting point to working on the budget. Additional consideration for projected increases or decreases in costs are also looked at and adjusted accordingly. While events of the past two years had negative health impacts, the Community realized positive financial impacts by the way of home and property sales and the income generated through those transactions. Despite the negative impacts, we are very fortunate and thankful for our members who continued to keep dues payments a priority. There are two parts to the budget Inflows money in and General Operating expensesmoney out. The totals for each of those sections must be the same. That is a balanced budget. There are lines for inflows including dues. It is important to not confuse Inflows incomemoney in with General Operating Expenses money out. INCOME: The primary source of income is dues. If you look at the bottom right side of the page for the proposed 20222023 Budget you will note the number of homes, lots and contiguous lots. If you take the number from the Homeowners dues inflow line 727,020.00 and divide it by the number of homes 577 your answer is 1260.00 the proposed dues for Homeowners. The same math applies for lots and contiguous lots. Dues discount is a projected amount of money that will reduce dues income as a result of members taking advantage of this payment option. The doubtful account line is the projected amount of money we will not receive from members who fail to pay their dues. This could be for a number of reasons valid and non-valid including but not limited to, foreclosure, bankruptcy, hardship, lack of priorities, abandonment of lots to foreclosure and tax sales. Effort is made whenever legally possible to pursue unpaid dues by the office staff, our attorney and through the legal system. Other Inflowsincome are estimated based on history and projection. Income from resale certificates and transfer fees can fluctuate depending on the home market. EXPENSES A majority of the expense lines are self explanatory. Some lines require additional explanation so not to give the appearance of duplication. There are three different payroll expense lines, one for the office, one for maintenance and the third payroll is included in the pool supplies and operations. Events of the past two years caused fluctuation in payroll expenses. Payroll bonus applies to all permanent employees. Currently there are 5 full time and 4 part time permanent employees. Full time permanent employees are offered health insurance. Participating employees currently there are 4 contribute through payroll deduction towards the premiums for this insurance. You may have noticed that there are two lines for the Dam. One line is for expenses connected with an annual inspection and the other is an annual fee charged to us by Department of Environmental Protection for having a dam. Private dams are subject to DEP annual fees based on their hazard rating. The dam at Conashaugh Lake is rated as a low hazard dam. The DEP determined that Flatbrook Way at the enhanced wetlands is also a dam however, we were able to forego registering it after requesting and receiving a registration waiver from the DEP. Imagine the costs incurred by some communities having multiple andor high risk dams. There are also two road lines. One is for repair of the roads which can include materials such as stone, culvert pipes, wood for guide rails, signage etc. In addition to the road repair line there is a road reserve line. In the past those funds were utilized to pave dirt roads. With the paving of dirt roads in the community almost completed, future funds to this account will include major repairs to maintain the roads. Miscellaneous expense can cover a number of expenses. Donations to the Fire Department, Humane Society or additional educational expenses for staff that may be needed and are over and above training budget. There are three security lines, one covers patrol services provided by our third party contractor and the second is for monitoring which includes the monthly costs for the tele-pad, alarm system for the office, repair replacement of cameras, dvrs and gate service and repairs. The third Security line is for a part time administrator specifically to oversee and handle Security matters. RESERVES On the reverse side of the Budget is the General Reserve schedule. This lists CLCAs larger owned assets. Nothing lasts forever and will eventually need to be repaired, roofed, sided, windows, septic, well pumps, restored or totally replaced or expanded. These funds are for that purpose. While we have these items insured, maintenance, deterioration and wear and tear are not covered by insurance. Thanks to reserves, Conashaugh is free of loans and interest payments for those loans. Reserves have also deterred the need to charge members for long term additional assessments. Not too many HOAs can say that. The list is reviewed and items no longer owned andor replaced are removed or updated. Funds for removed items that are no longer needed are redistributed to underfunded lines. Replacement costs will fluctuate and be adjusted up and down as needed. It should also be noted that the schedule of listed assets are periodically reviewed and the replacement cost may need to be adjusted up or down. As for the reserve schedule, the first column after the asset description is the original cost for that item. The amounts funded for certain items were questioned in the past. The funded amounts for the individual line items are not set in stone. In other words, if needed or decided those funds can be moved to another item. An example of what is being said here is as follows: Say that a vehicle or piece of equipment failed beyond repair and replacement was necessary. The replacement cost for that item by either or new or used item is 10,000 but the reserve line for that item was only funded for 5,000.00. The additional 5,000.00 could be moved from another item or items to make up the difference to enable the replacement. Hopefully the above will clarify some of the information concerning the proposed budget and reserve schedule. If you have any questions, please contact the office. Thank you.

Some express appreciation for the convenience of having a central location to bring their trash four days a week. Others express feeling a sense of punishment, reduced services that are entitled. It is true that before spring 2020 the compactor was available seven days a week. A number of reasons led to changes in that schedule, first and foremost, increased abuse by some residents dumping non household trash in the compactor. Examples include deposits of TVs, paint, unknown liquids, car batteries, large deposits of construction debris, bathroom fixrures and literally everything including a kitchen sink. Actions such as these expose the community to fines especially for items that are not permitted for disposal such as hazardous waste and electronics. In addition to these abuses some members were allowing friends and family access to our amenity. The more trash that is in the compactors, the more the cans have to be pulled at an added cost. Multiple calls were coming into the office that the compactor contained items that should not be there. Maintenance and office personnel were constantly running back and forth to run the compactor, sometimes having to pick up trash that was dumped because the unit was full. Much time was spent looking through videos for culprits who donned masks, hats, hoddies hiding their identities and some wisely parking their vehicles out of the range of cameras. Monitoring then began and although there may have been a decrease in the abuses, we were then faced with an impressive growth of residents. More people make more trash. The compactor does not operate by itself and we are not permitted to just leave a key for anyone who wishes to run it. Prior to 2020 Security monitored and ran the compactors. Members were concerned that opportunists were taking advantage during securitys time at the compactor. Someone independent of security patrol was hired to monitor the compactor. For anyone questioning this decision, it was a needed position to ensure that the compactor is run when needed. It also helped keep people a little more honest. Our budget for trash is 75,000.00. This amount is approximately 130.00 per homeowner. The current annual cost for a compactor monitor using the current four day schedule is 23,712.00. If the compactor was to be opened on its prior schedule which was 82 hours per week, the cost for a monitor would be 51,168.00. This amounts to an increased cost of 27,456.00 or approximately 50.00 per owner per year over the current budget. There would also be increased cost for workers comp with increased payroll. A number of communities do not include trash in their budget and their members are responsible for hiring their own trash company. Currently haulers are charging approximately 50.00 per month for a once per week pick up. If you are fortunate, you may get one trash and one recycle can. Those community members pay dues in addition to their trash bill. If you are on social media for the area you will note that service hasnt been the best for some with trash not picked up sometimes for weeks due to road conditions. In addition to regular trash the community holds two dumpster days, one in the fall and one in the spring. A majority of members appreciate this additional service. Then there are some who feel the service should be free. This service is over and above regular trash collection. A member should not have to pay the costs for another members home renovation, old furniture and carpet disposal. Just like members should not be paying for other members business trash.

Q: WHY DIDNT I SEE ASSOCIATION INFORMATION ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE, OR WHERE CAN I SEE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS BY CONASHAUGH LAKES COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION? A: There is one official Facebook page that is administered and monitored by staff and the Board of Directors for Conashaugh Lakes. The official page is named Conashaugh Lakes Community Association. There are a number of other pages containing Conashaugh in their title that are not administrated or sanctioned by the Board of Directors or staff. The official Conashaugh Facebook page is used notify our membership of community and local events, special announcements, lost and found pets and items, etc. Members are welcome to post and comment to the page but are reminded that it is a public page, therefore fighting, bullying of board members staffsecurityneighborslocal businesses is not tolerated and discovered comments determined to be of that nature will be removed. Continued disrespect for this rule will result in a user being blocked from the page. Blocking administrators of the official page is not permitted and will result in a user being blocked or removed. Q: WHY DO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAVE SPECIAL PRIVILEGES, LIKE HAVING KEYS TO TAKE THEIR GARBAGE TO THE COMPACTORS ANY TIME THEY WANT? A: The Conashaugh Lakes Community Associations Board of Directors as all Boards for Not-For-Profit Corporations are precluded by law from having any special privileges due to their positions. They are no different from any other member except that they volunteer their time and assume a fiduciary responsibility There can be legal ramifications to the Board member for malfeasance to keep our community safe and fiscally positive. Q: I PAY MY DUES, WHY CANT I DROP OFF MY GARBAGE ANY TIME I WANT? A: Conashaugh Lakes Community Association offers garbage disposal as one of its amenities. On average it costs Conashaugh Lakes 130.00 of dues total per year for homeowners to pay for disposal. This does vary a few dollars each year due to changing pricing by our waste management Companys annual contracts. This is much less than what it would cost our members to contract their own garbage pickup, which would be limited to one day a week and by bag count. The compactors schedule is at times modified, usually due to holidays, weather and personnel availability. We are currently seeking to hire one or two additional employees for the compactor. The shifts are Saturday 8-8, Sunday 10-8, Tuesday and Thursday 12:00  8:00. Shifts can be split. Pay is 12.00 per hour. Tasks include monitoring and running the compactor unit and maintaining a clean environment power washing when weather conditions permit, snow  leaf removal as needed Q: I DO NOT HAVE A PHONE CONNECTED TO THE TELE-PAD.

My name is Annette Musano. Most of the old timers know who I am but for the new CLCA members, allow me to introduce myself. I moved into the community in 2005 and was in awe of the tranquil beauty, peace and cohesiveness of this wonderful place. A few years and having a young son I later became involved with the Recreation Committee, taking part in organizing and carrying out of many events, mostly centered on our children. I was very impressed with the time and effort spent as well as the care and concern regarding the children of Conashaugh and I wanted to be involved. There also were adult events which I eventually began to participate with planning and carrying out. Six years ago I was approached by members of the board of directors asking me to fill an open position, however I declined due to lack of time. The following year I was approached again and that time said yes. I was serving my first year of my second term in May 2022 when I felt the need to resign in order to somehow protect and set straight the community and my family that I love so dearly. You see as a Board member I have had to abide by certain standards but I can no longer sit idly and passively and watch a certain resident and his followers try to take others down his rabbit hole with his onslaught of lies about our community, its board and employees. I resigned from the board in order to acknowledge the actual truth. I am particularly concerned about our new members who may still be learning about our community. I know it took me some time to get it all straight. Its certainly a lot to take in and can be overwhelming. This is also intended as a wake-up call to our long standing residents who may have become complacent. The members of the Board are volunteers. Theyre also good and honest people who work for this community to the best of their ability to keep it safe and functioning. These folks should at all times be treated with respect, the same as you would expect to be treated at your jobs. Some people need to be reminded that if something doesnt go their way that there typically is a good and solid reason and is not intended as a direct insult to anyone. Whether you know it or not, we need each and every one of our employees and we should all be grateful for their efforts and dedication. These few people do the jobs of many, taking care of 28 miles of road that are usually plowed better than Penn Dots attempt of plowing route 739. Office personnel see to the needs of over 570 home owners. Many repairs and projects that other communities outsource costing their members higher dues or assessments are handled here internally by our staff. It only stands to reason and logic that due to the small number of staff, not everyones need or wants can be handled at once but is done as expediently as possible. What some people fail to realize is that it is YOU the CLCA members who elect Board Members. The Board is charged with making decisions on behalf of the community. We all live here, raise our families here and just want to keep the community solvent and peaceful. We have no ulterior motives or hidden agendas as some have accused us of having. We have real jobs and careers to attend to, family responsibilities and social engagements like everyone else but yet make the time to serve the community. These volunteers have given up much including but not limited to time with their families and loved ones to attend meetings. Also, time is not often their friend as they have had to juggle schedules and reorganize their lives causing unavoidable delays in some decisions and projects. We are responsible to many governing bodies such as the EPA and Dingman Township who hold the control over issuing permits and declaring what can and cant be done. If you dont believe me just go to one of their meetings and see for yourself. I can guarantee you that your demands will not be met favorably. There are no benefits, monetary or otherwise to being on the board. Board members abide by the same bylaws, rules and regulations. They too throw out our trash on Tues, Thurs, Sat and Sundays, and DO NOT have keys to the compactor to suit their whims as another resident has claimed. All decisions are made carefully and deliberately for the good of all. Every financial decision is made painstakingly and thoughtfully. After all they pay the same dues as all members, its their investment too!! Every decision is thoroughly thought out, researched, discussed and agonized over. Just as in the real world not every decision is met with a favorable outcome by all members but instead made for the common good. The Board takes its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously. We should all be so very thankful to the Finance committee again all volunteers who through the years has kept dues as low as possible while keeping us solvent with a healthy reserve fund. Just take a look around at other communities who havent been as fortunate. There is so much more to this than meets the eye. It is an extremely difficult task to keeping amenities at a premium while keeping costs down. Just look at your own household budget and the sacrifices you must make for the good of your entire family, especially in the trying times we are living in. Getting every members opinion on every action and money spent, is near to an impossibility and not a requirement. The Board is elected to handle that on behalf of the community. It takes a great deal of time and effort to keep this community going. Members are welcome to join up to 2 committees at a time. Some of our committees have NO members other than the board liaisons. I have grown weary trying to beg members to join. As I see it, if youre not part of the solution, youre part of the problem especially if you are constantly critical of those of us trying to work it all out. What we need is cooperation and participation. We need members with thoughtful insights and suggestions, not a WATCHDOG who is constantly criticizing, belittling and accusing as well as spreading misinformation and falsehood. If you feel that something or some decision could have been made better or in a more productive way, say so in a positive not negative manner. We are human beings and not perfect, nor do we declare ourselves omnipotent as others may see it. So I implore you instead of sitting down at your computer and spouting off on Facebook, join a committee, check your personal agenda at the door and participate and help to make our community an even better place to live and raise your families. Use your time, talents and treasure to build up and not tear down. Think twice about the possible impact to your property value as you spread evil and incorrect connotations and innuendos about our community. For those of you may wish to berate me for this article, I have no intention of reading or responding to any snarky remarks. To borrow from a famous African phase, it takes a village, however only destruction ensues when the villagers pillage. I only hope you will take this in the spirit is was intended, for the sake of the good of us all for I am growing weary of watching the steady decline of the human race. Thank you for your time.

A special thank you to all our members, volunteers, and dedicated staff who together keep our community running and beautiful. Much appreciation to all the committee members and Board members who volunteer their time to assure our community is moving in the right direction. Together we can accomplish great things. And I look forward to this coming year. Many Blessings to all. Burning Within the Community All residents wishing to use burn barrels or campfire pits need to contact the office for a permit. It is a free, one-time process. The permit includes procedures to follow to ensure safety. It is important to call Pike County Communications 570296-7700 each time you burn. This is required by Dingman Township. You also need to call Security 570 832-5660 and inform the officer or leave a message that you are burning which includes your name, time, lot number and 911 address. By doing so you are helping prevent the possibility of a false alarm being responded to in the event that someone sees the fire and believes it to not be a controlled situation and calling 911. Our Township Fire Department consists of volunteers who are stretched thin enough without having to be called to a campfire. When burning please be considerate of your neighbors. There are many homes with open windows or people outside enjoying their own backyards. Never burn garbage, furniture, building materials or caustic materials. Always use a burn barrel or closed campfire ring. Do not burn anything uncontained on the ground. You should be cognizant of the possibility that what you burn into and leave on the ground has a good chance to one day end up in your well. There is no burning of tree stumps and brush without written permission of Conashaugh Lakes. Keep a hose at the site.

Kurt Budveit I have lived in Conashaugh Lakes for twenty-one years and am running for a second three year term on the Board of Directors. I currently serve as liaison for the Design Review and Rules and Regulations Committees. I look forward to continuing my service to this Community and doing my part for it to remain a safe, clean and great place to live without too many restrictions or unnecessary expense. Marisa Jara Hello Conashaugh Lakes members. My name is Marisa Jara, and my family and I have lived here for three years. I have taught in NY elementary schools for many years, and I have also operated my own childcare facility. We moved from New York, and I have to say it is different here and we are enjoying it. The surrounding trees and wildlife, and the quiet stillness is amazing. Shortly after we moved here the pandemic happened, and it was difficult to do things and meet people. I decided to join a committee; and since I love to entertain and plan fun activities for children I joined Recreation. I have met many delightful people, and together we have planned some activities for the community; the most popular one being the annual picnic. Through my work with Recreation, I was appointed to the Board in 2021, and have been serving as Board Secretary since October. I have enjoyed my time serving and including my thoughts and perspective to the Board discussions. I hope to continue meeting our residents at Recreation events and being a beneficial part of this community for the years to come. Rich Schlosser My name is Rich Schlosser. My wife Alice and I have lived in Conashaugh Lakes for 4 years now after raising our family on Long Island.

On Long Island I have volunteered with the Boy Scouts on the troop level when our sons were involved and then onto District and Council level as chairman of the Advancement Committee, helping scouts achieve the Eagle Rank by approving projects and Eagle board of reviews.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2022 PAGE 5 CLC ASSOCIATION Homeowners Association committees are a necessity for communities. Among the many benefits, they can provide valuable assistance to the Board of Directors and increase homeowner engagement. HOA board members are homeowners who volunteer to serve their community. As such, board members may not have enough time to take care of every aspect of the community with work, family, and other personal obligations. By having HOA standing committees, board members can delegate some of the tasks and responsibilities to volunteer homeowners. HOA standing committees can take care of the more basic tasks and make recommendations to the board while board members can focus on bigger HOA duties -- such as preparing financial reports, taking care of HOA funds, and planning capital improvement projects. With HOA boards and standing committees working together, the community will be able to function properly and seamlessly. One of the benefits of HOA standing committees is the ability of the board to draw upon the skills and talents of homeowners. It is important for residents to become involved in community matters. This enables residents to appreciate the importance of certain issues such as maintaining property values and resident safety. Since committee membership can change over time, many residents can participate in HOA communities. Joining HOA standing committees not only fosters community engagement but also helps the HOA board accomplish important community tasks. Please consider participating in one or two of Conashaugh Lakes Community Association Standing Committees contributing your talents and areas of expertise to the Community. Our Association Standing Committees and what they do: 1. Design Review Committee - to set architectural and building standards in the Community, supervise the review and approval of all building plans for homes in the Community. 2.

For Township information visit their website at www.dingmantownship.org Help Us Get Them Back to You Despite best efforts and diligence, some of our furry friends get away from their owners. Thanks to social media, help from the Pike County Humane Society, Security and office staff many of these pets are reunited with their families. We would like to continue with happy reunions and ask our members to help with this task. First, everyone should be aware that pets, particularly dogs are not allowed to roam. It is understood that some pets are expert escape artists and opportunists. There are number of things you can do to help get your pet returned it should be lost. 1. If your pet is a Houdini, please take extra care to keep them from escaping. Make sure gates and doors are secure and children know not to let them run out. 2. License your dog. It is the law. 3. Have them wear identification including a collar with a current phone number and tags. If you are expecting visitors with pets it is important that they have their pets wear identification. 4. Provide the office with a photo and information regarding your pet. Include their age, gender and name to keep on record. CLCA does not have a facility to hold found pets. If you decide to capture a roaming dog or cat, please be prepared to hold it until it can be picked up by the owner or the Humane Society. Security and CLCA Staff are not animal handlers and will not pursue or retrieve a dog at large. Members may contact us to report finding a pet by calling the office or security or sending a message by FB Messenger or email. Please note that social media and email are not monitored 247. When reporting a found pet, please include description and contact information. Should you need to call them, the phone number for the Pike County Humane Society is 570-296-7654 and Pike County Dog Warden is 570-350-3589. The Pike County Treasurers Office maintains a database of dog licenses that are issued. Their number is 570-296-3441.",

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2022 PAGE 7 CLC ASSOCIATION All Members will be receiving a packet in the mail which contains information regarding the CLCA Annual Meeting. This years meeting takes place Saturday September 24th, 2022. Included in the packet will be the 20222023 Proposed Budget and the CLCA Reserve schedule. At the time of this article the current U.S. inflation rate is 9.06. The state of the economy weighs on all of us. Increased costs for fuel and power impacted by inflation continue to be seen. These impacts dont end at our gas pump or electric panel box but affect vendors that provide services and materials for us to operate. The Finance Committee is committed to preparing a detailed, fair budget each year and worked diligently to bring a proposed budget which includes a 2  two percent increase for the 20222023 fiscal year for homes and contiguous lots. Lots that are not developed have a zero proposed increase. The Committee would like our Members to have an understanding of our Budget and Reserve Schedules. The following is in an effort to walk you through these two documents and the differences between them. The Budget is for the day to day operation of the community think of it as checkbook for dailymonthly operating expenses and the Reserve schedule is for replacement of large assets such as major building repairs or renovations, trucks and larger equipment replacement think of it as a savings account. BUDGET For those of you who may not know this, unlike a number of communities in the area, our members vote on the budget. The CLCA budget is worked on by the Finance Committee. As with all of our Committees, any member in good standing is welcome to attend the meetings. Work on the budget typically begins in June. Averages of actual expenses for the past three years are the starting point to working on the budget. Additional consideration for projected increases or decreases in costs are also looked at and adjusted accordingly. While events of the past two years had negative health impacts, the Community realized positive financial impacts by the way of home and property sales and the income generated through those transactions. Despite the negative impacts, we are very fortunate and thankful for our members who continued to keep dues payments a priority. There are two parts to the budget Inflows money in and General Operating expensesmoney out. The totals for each of those sections must be the same. That is a balanced budget. There are lines for inflows including dues. It is important to not confuse Inflows incomemoney in with General Operating Expenses money out. INCOME: The primary source of income is dues. If you look at the bottom right side of the page for the proposed 20222023 Budget you will note the number of homes, lots and contiguous lots. If you take the number from the Homeowners dues inflow line 727,020.00 and divide it by the number of homes 577 your answer is 1260.00 the proposed dues for Homeowners. The same math applies for lots and contiguous lots. Dues discount is a projected amount of money that will reduce dues income as a result of members taking advantage of this payment option. The doubtful account line is the projected amount of money we will not receive from members who fail to pay their dues. This could be for a number of reasons valid and non-valid including but not limited to, foreclosure, bankruptcy, hardship, lack of priorities, abandonment of lots to foreclosure and tax sales. Effort is made whenever legally possible to pursue unpaid dues by the office staff, our attorney and through the legal system. Other Inflowsincome are estimated based on history and projection. Income from resale certificates and transfer fees can fluctuate depending on the home market. EXPENSES A majority of the expense lines are self explanatory. Some lines require additional explanation so not to give the appearance of duplication. There are three different payroll expense lines, one for the office, one for maintenance and the third payroll is included in the pool supplies and operations. Events of the past two years caused fluctuation in payroll expenses. Payroll bonus applies to all permanent employees. Currently there are 5 full time and 4 part time permanent employees. Full time permanent employees are offered health insurance. Participating employees currently there are 4 contribute through payroll deduction towards the premiums for this insurance. You may have noticed that there are two lines for the Dam. One line is for expenses connected with an annual inspection and the other is an annual fee charged to us by Department of Environmental Protection for having a dam. Private dams are subject to DEP annual fees based on their hazard rating. The dam at Conashaugh Lake is rated as a low hazard dam. The DEP determined that Flatbrook Way at the enhanced wetlands is also a dam however, we were able to forego registering it after requesting and receiving a registration waiver from the DEP. Imagine the costs incurred by some communities having multiple andor high risk dams. There are also two road lines. One is for repair of the roads which can include materials such as stone, culvert pipes, wood for guide rails, signage etc. In addition to the road repair line there is a road reserve line. In the past those funds were utilized to pave dirt roads. With the paving of dirt roads in the community almost completed, future funds to this account will include major repairs to maintain the roads. Miscellaneous expense can cover a number of expenses. Donations to the Fire Department, Humane Society or additional educational expenses for staff that may be needed and are over and above training budget. There are three security lines, one covers patrol services provided by our third party contractor and the second is for monitoring which includes the monthly costs for the tele-pad, alarm system for the office, repair replacement of cameras, dvrs and gate service and repairs. The third Security line is for a part time administrator specifically to oversee and handle Security matters. RESERVES On the reverse side of the Budget is the General Reserve schedule. This lists CLCAs larger owned assets. Nothing lasts forever and will eventually need to be repaired, roofed, sided, windows, septic, well pumps, restored or totally replaced or expanded. These funds are for that purpose. While we have these items insured, maintenance, deterioration and wear and tear are not covered by insurance. Thanks to reserves, Conashaugh is free of loans and interest payments for those loans. Reserves have also deterred the need to charge members for long term additional assessments. Not too many HOAs can say that. The list is reviewed and items no longer owned andor replaced are removed or updated. Funds for removed items that are no longer needed are redistributed to underfunded lines. Replacement costs will fluctuate and be adjusted up and down as needed. It should also be noted that the schedule of listed assets are periodically reviewed and the replacement cost may need to be adjusted up or down. As for the reserve schedule, the first column after the asset description is the original cost for that item. The amounts funded for certain items were questioned in the past. The funded amounts for the individual line items are not set in stone. In other words, if needed or decided those funds can be moved to another item. An example of what is being said here is as follows: Say that a vehicle or piece of equipment failed beyond repair and replacement was necessary. The replacement cost for that item by either or new or used item is 10,000 but the reserve line for that item was only funded for 5,000.00. The additional 5,000.00 could be moved from another item or items to make up the difference to enable the replacement. Hopefully the above will clarify some of the information concerning the proposed budget and reserve schedule. If you have any questions, please contact the office. Thank you.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2022 PAGE 11 Trash There have been many discussions regarding operation hours four our compactors. Some express appreciation for the convenience of having a central location to bring their trash four days a week. Others express feeling a sense of punishment, reduced services that are entitled. It is true that before spring 2020 the compactor was available seven days a week. A number of reasons led to changes in that schedule, first and foremost, increased abuse by some residents dumping non household trash in the compactor. Examples include deposits of TVs, paint, unknown liquids, car batteries, large deposits of construction debris, bathroom fixrures and literally everything including a kitchen sink. Actions such as these expose the community to fines especially for items that are not permitted for disposal such as hazardous waste and electronics. In addition to these abuses some members were allowing friends and family access to our amenity. The more trash that is in the compactors, the more the cans have to be pulled at an added cost. Multiple calls were coming into the office that the compactor contained items that should not be there. Maintenance and office personnel were constantly running back and forth to run the compactor, sometimes having to pick up trash that was dumped because the unit was full. Much time was spent looking through videos for culprits who donned masks, hats, hoddies hiding their identities and some wisely parking their vehicles out of the range of cameras. Monitoring then began and although there may have been a decrease in the abuses, we were then faced with an impressive growth of residents. More people make more trash. The compactor does not operate by itself and we are not permitted to just leave a key for anyone who wishes to run it. Prior to 2020 Security monitored and ran the compactors. Members were concerned that opportunists were taking advantage during securitys time at the compactor. Someone independent of security patrol was hired to monitor the compactor. For anyone questioning this decision, it was a needed position to ensure that the compactor is run when needed. It also helped keep people a little more honest. Our budget for trash is 75,000.00. This amount is approximately 130.00 per homeowner. The current annual cost for a compactor monitor using the current four day schedule is 23,712.00. If the compactor was to be opened on its prior schedule which was 82 hours per week, the cost for a monitor would be 51,168.00. This amounts to an increased cost of 27,456.00 or approximately 50.00 per owner per year over the current budget. There would also be increased cost for workers comp with increased payroll. A number of communities do not include trash in their budget and their members are responsible for hiring their own trash company. Currently haulers are charging approximately 50.00 per month for a once per week pick up. If you are fortunate, you may get one trash and one recycle can. Those community members pay dues in addition to their trash bill. If you are on social media for the area you will note that service hasnt been the best for some with trash not picked up sometimes for weeks due to road conditions. In addition to regular trash the community holds two dumpster days, one in the fall and one in the spring. A majority of members appreciate this additional service. Then there are some who feel the service should be free. This service is over and above regular trash collection. A member should not have to pay the costs for another members home renovation, old furniture and carpet disposal. Just like members should not be paying for other members business trash.

Q: WHY DIDNT I SEE ASSOCIATION INFORMATION ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE, OR WHERE CAN I SEE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS BY CONASHAUGH LAKES COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION? A: There is one official Facebook page that is administered and monitored by staff and the Board of Directors for Conashaugh Lakes. The official page is named Conashaugh Lakes Community Association. There are a number of other pages containing Conashaugh in their title that are not administrated or sanctioned by the Board of Directors or staff. The official Conashaugh Facebook page is used notify our membership of community and local events, special announcements, lost and found pets and items, etc. Members are welcome to post and comment to the page but are reminded that it is a public page, therefore fighting, bullying of board members staffsecurityneighborslocal businesses is not tolerated and discovered comments determined to be of that nature will be removed. Continued disrespect for this rule will result in a user being blocked from the page. Blocking administrators of the official page is not permitted and will result in a user being blocked or removed. Q: WHY DO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAVE SPECIAL PRIVILEGES, LIKE HAVING KEYS TO TAKE THEIR GARBAGE TO THE COMPACTORS ANY TIME THEY WANT? A: The Conashaugh Lakes Community Associations Board of Directors as all Boards for Not-For-Profit Corporations are precluded by law from having any special privileges due to their positions. They are no different from any other member except that they volunteer their time and assume a fiduciary responsibility There can be legal ramifications to the Board member for malfeasance to keep our community safe and fiscally positive. Q: I PAY MY DUES, WHY CANT I DROP OFF MY GARBAGE ANY TIME I WANT? A: Conashaugh Lakes Community Association offers garbage disposal as one of its amenities. On average it costs Conashaugh Lakes 130.00 of dues total per year for homeowners to pay for disposal. This does vary a few dollars each year due to changing pricing by our waste management Companys annual contracts. This is much less than what it would cost our members to contract their own garbage pickup, which would be limited to one day a week and by bag count. The compactors schedule is at times modified, usually due to holidays, weather and personnel availability. We are currently seeking to hire one or two additional employees for the compactor. The shifts are Saturday 8-8, Sunday 10-8, Tuesday and Thursday 12:00  8:00. Shifts can be split. Pay is 12.00 per hour. Tasks include monitoring and running the compactor unit and maintaining a clean environment power washing when weather conditions permit, snow  leaf removal as needed Q: I DO NOT HAVE A PHONE CONNECTED TO THE TELE-PAD.

        "content": "CONASHAUGH COURIER  SUMMER 2022 PAGE 16 Hello everyone. My name is Annette Musano. Most of the old timers know who I am but for the new CLCA members, allow me to introduce myself. I moved into the community in 2005 and was in awe of the tranquil beauty, peace and cohesiveness of this wonderful place. A few years and having a young son I later became involved with the Recreation Committee, taking part in organizing and carrying out of many events, mostly centered on our children. I was very impressed with the time and effort spent as well as the care and concern regarding the children of Conashaugh and I wanted to be involved. There also were adult events which I eventually began to participate with planning and carrying out. Six years ago I was approached by members of the board of directors asking me to fill an open position, however I declined due to lack of time. The following year I was approached again and that time said yes. I was serving my first year of my second term in May 2022 when I felt the need to resign in order to somehow protect and set straight the community and my family that I love so dearly. You see as a Board member I have had to abide by certain standards but I can no longer sit idly and passively and watch a certain resident and his followers try to take others down his rabbit hole with his onslaught of lies about our community, its board and employees. I resigned from the board in order to acknowledge the actual truth. I am particularly concerned about our new members who may still be learning about our community. I know it took me some time to get it all straight. Its certainly a lot to take in and can be overwhelming. This is also intended as a wake-up call to our long standing residents who may have become complacent. The members of the Board are volunteers. Theyre also good and honest people who work for this community to the best of their ability to keep it safe and functioning. These folks should at all times be treated with respect, the same as you would expect to be treated at your jobs. Some people need to be reminded that if something doesnt go their way that there typically is a good and solid reason and is not intended as a direct insult to anyone. Whether you know it or not, we need each and every one of our employees and we should all be grateful for their efforts and dedication. These few people do the jobs of many, taking care of 28 miles of road that are usually plowed better than Penn Dots attempt of plowing route 739. Office personnel see to the needs of over 570 home owners. Many repairs and projects that other communities outsource costing their members higher dues or assessments are handled here internally by our staff. It only stands to reason and logic that due to the small number of staff, not everyones need or wants can be handled at once but is done as expediently as possible. What some people fail to realize is that it is YOU the CLCA members who elect Board Members. The Board is charged with making decisions on behalf of the community. We all live here, raise our families here and just want to keep the community solvent and peaceful. We have no ulterior motives or hidden agendas as some have accused us of having. We have real jobs and careers to attend to, family responsibilities and social engagements like everyone else but yet make the time to serve the community. These volunteers have given up much including but not limited to time with their families and loved ones to attend meetings. Also, time is not often their friend as they have had to juggle schedules and reorganize their lives causing unavoidable delays in some decisions and projects. We are responsible to many governing bodies such as the EPA and Dingman Township who hold the control over issuing permits and declaring what can and cant be done. If you dont believe me just go to one of their meetings and see for yourself. I can guarantee you that your demands will not be met favorably. There are no benefits, monetary or otherwise to being on the board. Board members abide by the same bylaws, rules and regulations. They too throw out our trash on Tues, Thurs, Sat and Sundays, and DO NOT have keys to the compactor to suit their whims as another resident has claimed. All decisions are made carefully and deliberately for the good of all. Every financial decision is made painstakingly and thoughtfully. After all they pay the same dues as all members, its their investment too!! Every decision is thoroughly thought out, researched, discussed and agonized over. Just as in the real world not every decision is met with a favorable outcome by all members but instead made for the common good. The Board takes its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously. We should all be so very thankful to the Finance committee again all volunteers who through the years has kept dues as low as possible while keeping us solvent with a healthy reserve fund. Just take a look around at other communities who havent been as fortunate. There is so much more to this than meets the eye. It is an extremely difficult task to keeping amenities at a premium while keeping costs down. Just look at your own household budget and the sacrifices you must make for the good of your entire family, especially in the trying times we are living in. Getting every members opinion on every action and money spent, is near to an impossibility and not a requirement. The Board is elected to handle that on behalf of the community. It takes a great deal of time and effort to keep this community going. Members are welcome to join up to 2 committees at a time. Some of our committees have NO members other than the board liaisons. I have grown weary trying to beg members to join. As I see it, if youre not part of the solution, youre part of the problem especially if you are constantly critical of those of us trying to work it all out. What we need is cooperation and participation. We need members with thoughtful insights and suggestions, not a WATCHDOG who is constantly criticizing, belittling and accusing as well as spreading misinformation and falsehood. If you feel that something or some decision could have been made better or in a more productive way, say so in a positive not negative manner. We are human beings and not perfect, nor do we declare ourselves omnipotent as others may see it. So I implore you instead of sitting down at your computer and spouting off on Facebook, join a committee, check your personal agenda at the door and participate and help to make our community an even better place to live and raise your families. Use your time, talents and treasure to build up and not tear down. Think twice about the possible impact to your property value as you spread evil and incorrect connotations and innuendos about our community. For those of you may wish to berate me for this article, I have no intention of reading or responding to any snarky remarks. To borrow from a famous African phase, it takes a village, however only destruction ensues when the villagers pillage. I only hope you will take this in the spirit is was intended, for the sake of the good of us all for I am growing weary of watching the steady decline of the human race. Thank you for your time.

For the past 20 years my family and I have enjoyed the many wonderful aspects of living here in Conashaugh Lakes. Through those years both my husband Jim and I have volunteered for several different committees within Conashaugh and beyond. We raised all four of our children here and believe this community is among the better things life has to offer. Recently retired, Jim and I are both grateful to be experiencing the quite life Conashaugh has to offer in the beautiful Poconos. Its the little things in life that truly mean so much. Three years ago I ran for a position on the board and was extremely honored to have been voted in. This year I became the president and while still honored Im also blessed to volunteer my time for a community I love and am proud to live in. Although the past 2 years have been challenging at times for all of us, we continued to move forward while keeping everyone safe. I would like to thank you all for your patience. I look forward to many more years of enjoying all the aspects this beautiful community has to offer. If you would like to volunteer for one of the several committees here please contact the office. Your time and ideas are appreciated. Thank you! Betty Buccine Betty Buccine 570.296.9200 CALL NOW!

My name is Gary Linton, your new Community Administrator. I come from an eclectic background which has given me a vast skill set I intend to use for Conashaugh Lakes. From being a retired Police Investigator, to businessman and Executive Director and CFO of several not-for-profit incorporations. I have also worked for other communities, as the Community Manager of Shawnees Northslope III, through First Service Residential Group, in East Stroudsburg and Chief of Public Safety for Pine Ridge in Bushkill. We are so lucky here in Conashaugh Lakes, being one of the few communities in the Poconos that is financially sound and we have no crime. My priorities are to maintain these two conditions. I know many of you already, and look forward to meeting all of you. I hope we can all work together to make this community even better than it already is for you and your families. Gary Linton New Board Member Welcome to Ms. Laura Elaro being appointed to serve on the Conashaugh Lakes Community Associations Board of Director. Ms. Elaro has served this community in many ways and donated her time to many volunteer activities over the16 year Conashaugh Lakes residency. With two DVHS graduates and one child still in school district she remains fully involved in our community and our area. We look forward to her input and working with her for the betterment of our community. A Retirement Well Deserved Jeanne Calabrese who has served as our faithful community administrator for 11 years has decided to retire, as of December 30, 2021, from the workforce. This was a decision made not in haste but rather well thought out and planned over a period of 2 years through continued recovery from personal tragedy. Despite all odds of what her and her family were going through, Jeanne managed to perform her job related duties at high efficiency, keeping our wonderful community affairs well taken care of. Ever since she assumed the role as administrator Jeanne more often than not worked many more hours, taking over many responsibilities than she was ever monetarily compensated. Also prior to this role she served the community as a volunteer and member of the board of directors for several years. For all of this, Jeanne we owe you thanks beyond what words can say. What we can say, however, is that we wish you and Ed continued healing and peace. We wish you a retirement full of all the goodness that life can offer - fun times with family and friends, safe and wonderful travel adventures and time to do what makes you happy and fulfills your hobbies and interests. May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon you face. May the rain fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hand. Arrivederci cara amica. See you around the community. Dear Members, As you know we lost the loop due to our phone company accusing us of spamming. We have been looking for an alternative so communications between the administration and our members can be restored without relying on Facebook. I am pleased to announce that we have found a new platform for mass emails called Sendinblue. We are beginning to set up the platform and populate it with the email addresses we have from the loop. This should not take too long. If you are new to Conashaugh and have not given the office your email, please do so at your earliest opportunity be sending an email to administratorconashaughlakes.com with Add Me to Sendinblue in the subject line. Thank you CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2022 PAGE 4 CLCA NEWS 911 Signs Every residence is required to have a 911 sign that is clearly visible. 911 signs may be ordered from the Dingman Township Volunteer Fire Department. Applications can be found on the Conashaugh Website. Installation of 911 signs need to be a minimum of five feet from the edge of the road. Do I Need a Permit? Spring is a great time for home improvement projects both indoors and out. Below is a partial list of more common projects done by homeowners and require permits from the CLCA Office. There may be some misunderstanding about permit fees and recent changes to them. First, please note that the only fee that has been changed is for new homes that are being built. The original fee was 300.00 and was increased to 400.00. This is a direct result in a surge in property sales for development and the amount of administrative work involved with these properties. As you will see with the list below, many permits are free of charge. Roof Replacement No Fee Painting exterior of home or siding change color approval No Fee Swimming Pools, spas  hot tubs 50.00 Above ground pool 100.00 In-ground pool Hot tub No Fee Fences No Fee Decks 35.00 fee Fire pitsBurning on property one time permit w instructions to follow when burning Tree  Brush removal No Fees Major Landscaping projects or to change property grade No Fee Driveway Inspection for paving  No Fee Additions or Detached Garage  100.00 Fee For tree and brush removal permits simply mark trees and areas with ribbon. Please do not spray paint or use other means of permanent marking. Contact the office and request an inspection. The inspection will be conducted within ten business days. Display tree permits at the entrance of your property in a conspicuous location. As a reminder tent-like storage structures are not permitted in the community. If you install one, you will be required to remove it within 30 days of being notified. Remind contractors to not block roadways and to use proper signage andor traffic alert equipment while working at your property. Please note and plan accordingly for projects that may need to be reviewed and approved by the CLCA Design Review Committee. This Committee meets the third Saturday of each month. Additional permits may be required from Dingman Township. For Township information visit their website at http:www.dingmantownship.org. If you have questions regarding a project or whether permits are needed, please contact the CLCA Office. CLCA Office Finally Getting a Facelift Over the past couple of years, the Board discussed the need for a new or expanded office. Past requests to paint the existing space were tabled with that possibility. Due to the unlikelihood that a new or expanded office was happening in the near future, the Board was again approached to paint the office in August 2021 at which time a discussion ensued and the realization of a need for more than painting was agreed. The Board passed a motion in August 2021 to allow up 10,000.00 for improvements which includes painting of the interior office, new desks, window coverings and new flooring and lighting fixtures in the lobby. The office is the gateway to our Community and although it is closed to public traffic due to COVID concerns at this time, it will eventually reopen. When it does reopen we wish for it to be a welcoming, updated environment for our members and guests. Our employees are also deserving of a good work environment. The office was last painted in 2007 by non-paid volunteers. Most of the office furniture was picked from dumpster day events. Curtains are hand-me-downs as well as the seating in the reception area. Capital improvements such as a deck, new windows, main entry door, electric baseboard and electric panels were addressed following the 2007 painting. To keep costs down, the work is being completed by staff and volunteers. As of this writing a majority of the materials and equipment have been purchased for 6400.00. Expected future costs will be minimal. There has been concern expressed about the budget for this project. Although COVID is not known to provide a lot of benefits, our Community was fortunate to reap one. Due to the surge in property sales following the onset of COVID our Community received additional income to effect this project. No money was removed from reserves or normal operating income. There will be no requests, surcharges, levied to our members to pay for the cost of this project. Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are in our future. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, we have a lot of new members who may not be as familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. What is a road ban? It is a period of time when vehicles exceeding 10,000 lbs are prohibited entry in the Community. How long do they last? These bans are to protect our roads from damage during thaw periods. We are permitted a total of eight weeks for the bans. As of this writing we have experienced colder temperatures although not consistently. Whether a ban will take place is determined by weather conditions. We still have February and March to watch conditions. There are no set dates for bans. Road and weather conditions are checked weekly by maintenance and may be intermittent. Road bans are limited to eight weeks and may be lifted and reinstated. They are totally weather driven. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP, our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes and website, www.conashaughlakes.com. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they were not aware or forgot about bans. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company, USPS, UPS, and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation.

Although we are a private Community we are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. They have full access to the Community and do come in to enforce rules including but not limited to possession of fishing licenses and boat safety equipment. Be aware of life jacket and safety equipment that is required when on the water. All children 12 years of age and younger on all Commonwealth waters must wear a life jacket while underway on any boat 20 feet in length or less and on all canoes and kayaks. Underway includes drifting boats. For boating and fishing rules please visit https:www.fishandboat.com Pagesdefault.aspx Dont be fooled by a warm beautiful day, especially in the spring and fall. Water temps are still frigid. Cold water can kill quickly. You can be a great swimmer but you cannot swim when overcome by hypothermia. Life jackets are required to be worn by all between November 1 through April 30th when on a boat 16 feet or less and all canoes and kayaks. Although we are not in ice season, it will come soon enough. For information on ice safety visit, https:www.fishandboat. comFishFishingPages IceWinterFishing.aspx Dear Friends and Neighbors of CLCA, Please be aware that any comments made on the Residents FB page are opinions and not always factual. This page unfortunately often presents itself as a gossip column depicting derrogatory remarks and paints our community in a negative connotation. As we still live in the USA and freedom of speech is a right granted to all citizens, we, members of the Board, elected by you, the community, have no means of putting an end to this banter. However, we are obliged to inform you of the many false accusations being made due to some incorrect interpretations of actual truths. We implore you to please refer to the official CLCA FB page as well as the beautiful web site created for all of us when you are searching for information. We welcome all members to attend the membership meetings held the second Saturday of every month at 10:30 am in the Rec building. Please remember that the Board members are merely elected volunteers who often have to make tough decisions which affect all members as we too live here and have a vested interest in our community and property values. We too have jobs and families to care for and make the time to assure a positive outcome for the greater good of our community. We do not receive any compensation, monitarily or otherwise for our efforts as decisions affect us the same as the rest of the members of CLCA, nor do we have any hidden agenda. We welcome your opinions and constructive critisms in a non accusatory manner. We thank you for your time. CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2022 PAGE 10 CLCA NEWS GOT STUFF?

FAQ: For many of our new members and for those who may have forgotten. Q: Why didnt I see association information on the FaceBook page, or where can I see official announcements by Conashaugh Lakes Community Association? A: There are three FaceBook pages generally recognized in Conashaugh Lakes. The official page is named Conashaugh Lakes Community Association and the others are Residents Conashaugh Lakes Community; and Residents of Conashaugh Lakes Unofficial. The official page is used by the administration to notify our membership of events, weather conditions, compactor hours, special announcements and such. The Residents pages are used as a forum for our members to sell items, answer new members questions about locating services in our area, commenting their pleasure or displeasure as to events, Board decisions and Administration procedures. The Administration does not use the Residents page for any announcements. Members will at times share a post from the official page to the Residents Page. It is always good to check the official page when you are on FaceBook to see the administrations posts. Q: Why do the Board of Directors have special privileges, like having keys to take their garbage to the compactors any time they want? A: The Conashaugh Lakes Community Associations Board of Directors as all Boards for Not-For-Profit Corporations are precluded by law from having any special privileges due to their positions. They are no different from any other member except that they volunteer their time and assume a fiduciary responsibility There can be legal ramifications to the Board member for malfeasance to keep our community safe and fiscally positive. Q: I pay my dues, why cant I drop off my garbage any time I want. A: Conashaugh Lakes Community Association offers garbage disposal as one of its amenities. On average it costs Conashaugh Lakes 100.00 of your dues total per year to pay for disposal. This does vary a few dollars each year due to changing pricing by our waste management Companys annual contracts. This is much less that what it would cost our members to contract their own garbage pickup, which would be limited to one day a week and by bag count. Our schedule of hours was voted on at the same time the members of Conashaugh Lakes voted to move the compactors to the front entrance. The compactors schedule is at times modified, usually due to holidays, weather and personnel availability, which has been affected by Covid. This administration will always try to make up any lost hours when possible.

For the past 20 years my family and I have enjoyed the many wonderful aspects of living here in Conashaugh Lakes. Through those years both my husband Jim and I have volunteered for several different committees within Conashaugh and beyond. We raised all four of our children here and believe this community is among the better things life has to offer. Recently retired, Jim and I are both grateful to be experiencing the quite life Conashaugh has to offer in the beautiful Poconos. Its the little things in life that truly mean so much. Three years ago I ran for a position on the board and was extremely honored to have been voted in. This year I became the president and while still honored Im also blessed to volunteer my time for a community I love and am proud to live in. Although the past 2 years have been challenging at times for all of us, we continued to move forward while keeping everyone safe. I would like to thank you all for your patience. I look forward to many more years of enjoying all the aspects this beautiful community has to offer. If you would like to volunteer for one of the several committees here please contact the office.

My name is Gary Linton, your new Community Administrator. I come from an eclectic background which has given me a vast skill set I intend to use for Conashaugh Lakes. From being a retired Police Investigator, to businessman and Executive Director and CFO of several not-for-profit incorporations. I have also worked for other communities, as the Community Manager of Shawnees Northslope III, through First Service Residential Group, in East Stroudsburg and Chief of Public Safety for Pine Ridge in Bushkill. We are so lucky here in Conashaugh Lakes, being one of the few communities in the Poconos that is financially sound and we have no crime. My priorities are to maintain these two conditions. I know many of you already, and look forward to meeting all of you. I hope we can all work together to make this community even better than it already is for you and your families. Gary Linton New Board Member Welcome to Ms. Laura Elaro being appointed to serve on the Conashaugh Lakes Community Associations Board of Director. Ms. Elaro has served this community in many ways and donated her time to many volunteer activities over the16 year Conashaugh Lakes residency. With two DVHS graduates and one child still in school district she remains fully involved in our community and our area. We look forward to her input and working with her for the betterment of our community. A Retirement Well Deserved Jeanne Calabrese who has served as our faithful community administrator for 11 years has decided to retire, as of December 30, 2021, from the workforce. This was a decision made not in haste but rather well thought out and planned over a period of 2 years through continued recovery from personal tragedy. Despite all odds of what her and her family were going through, Jeanne managed to perform her job related duties at high efficiency, keeping our wonderful community affairs well taken care of. Ever since she assumed the role as administrator Jeanne more often than not worked many more hours, taking over many responsibilities than she was ever monetarily compensated. Also prior to this role she served the community as a volunteer and member of the board of directors for several years. For all of this, Jeanne we owe you thanks beyond what words can say. What we can say, however, is that we wish you and Ed continued healing and peace. We wish you a retirement full of all the goodness that life can offer - fun times with family and friends, safe and wonderful travel adventures and time to do what makes you happy and fulfills your hobbies and interests. May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon you face. May the rain fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hand. Arrivederci cara amica. See you around the community. Dear Members, As you know we lost the loop due to our phone company accusing us of spamming. We have been looking for an alternative so communications between the administration and our members can be restored without relying on Facebook.

Applications can be found on the Conashaugh Website. Installation of 911 signs need to be a minimum of five feet from the edge of the road. Do I Need a Permit? Spring is a great time for home improvement projects both indoors and out. Below is a partial list of more common projects done by homeowners and require permits from the CLCA Office. There may be some misunderstanding about permit fees and recent changes to them. First, please note that the only fee that has been changed is for new homes that are being built. The original fee was 300.00 and was increased to 400.00. This is a direct result in a surge in property sales for development and the amount of administrative work involved with these properties. As you will see with the list below, many permits are free of charge. Roof Replacement No Fee Painting exterior of home or siding change color approval No Fee Swimming Pools, spas  hot tubs 50.00 Above ground pool 100.00 In-ground pool Hot tub No Fee Fences No Fee Decks 35.00 fee Fire pitsBurning on property one time permit w instructions to follow when burning Tree  Brush removal No Fees Major Landscaping projects or to change property grade No Fee Driveway Inspection for paving  No Fee Additions or Detached Garage  100.00 Fee For tree and brush removal permits simply mark trees and areas with ribbon. Please do not spray paint or use other means of permanent marking. Contact the office and request an inspection. The inspection will be conducted within ten business days. Display tree permits at the entrance of your property in a conspicuous location. As a reminder tent-like storage structures are not permitted in the community. If you install one, you will be required to remove it within 30 days of being notified. Remind contractors to not block roadways and to use proper signage andor traffic alert equipment while working at your property. Please note and plan accordingly for projects that may need to be reviewed and approved by the CLCA Design Review Committee. This Committee meets the third Saturday of each month. Additional permits may be required from Dingman Township. For Township information visit their website at http:www.dingmantownship.org. If you have questions regarding a project or whether permits are needed, please contact the CLCA Office. CLCA Office Finally Getting a Facelift Over the past couple of years, the Board discussed the need for a new or expanded office. Past requests to paint the existing space were tabled with that possibility. Due to the unlikelihood that a new or expanded office was happening in the near future, the Board was again approached to paint the office in August 2021 at which time a discussion ensued and the realization of a need for more than painting was agreed. The Board passed a motion in August 2021 to allow up 10,000.00 for improvements which includes painting of the interior office, new desks, window coverings and new flooring and lighting fixtures in the lobby. The office is the gateway to our Community and although it is closed to public traffic due to COVID concerns at this time, it will eventually reopen. When it does reopen we wish for it to be a welcoming, updated environment for our members and guests. Our employees are also deserving of a good work environment. The office was last painted in 2007 by non-paid volunteers. Most of the office furniture was picked from dumpster day events. Curtains are hand-me-downs as well as the seating in the reception area. Capital improvements such as a deck, new windows, main entry door, electric baseboard and electric panels were addressed following the 2007 painting. To keep costs down, the work is being completed by staff and volunteers. As of this writing a majority of the materials and equipment have been purchased for 6400.00. Expected future costs will be minimal. There has been concern expressed about the budget for this project. Although COVID is not known to provide a lot of benefits, our Community was fortunate to reap one. Due to the surge in property sales following the onset of COVID our Community received additional income to effect this project. No money was removed from reserves or normal operating income. There will be no requests, surcharges, levied to our members to pay for the cost of this project. Road Ban Ahead! Important Information, Please Read Its that time of year again to remind everyone that road bans are in our future. Many of you know the drill for this annual event. However, we have a lot of new members who may not be as familiar with the bans or the restrictions that come with them. What is a road ban? It is a period of time when vehicles exceeding 10,000 lbs are prohibited entry in the Community. How long do they last? These bans are to protect our roads from damage during thaw periods. We are permitted a total of eight weeks for the bans. As of this writing we have experienced colder temperatures although not consistently. Whether a ban will take place is determined by weather conditions. We still have February and March to watch conditions. There are no set dates for bans. Road and weather conditions are checked weekly by maintenance and may be intermittent. Road bans are limited to eight weeks and may be lifted and reinstated. They are totally weather driven. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be instituted and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could put the ban on hold. Every effort is made to give as much notice as possible before a ban is imposed. While it is only an estimated window, and can be altered by weather conditions, bans typically run in mid-February or March. Ban notices will be posted at the entrances, via the LOOP, our Facebook page at https:www.facebook.comconashaughlakes and website, www.conashaughlakes.com. Please keep road bans in mind if you are ordering furniture, appliances, building materials, non-emergency septic cleaning or services in need of vehicles greater than the prohibited weight. Alert your carriers of the ban. Many if not all delivery companies are aware of road bans and the need to use smaller vehicles during the ban period. Despite annual reminders of the ban, some members schedule deliveries that are not permitted and say they were not aware or forgot about bans. There have been past occasions where members were required to meet a prohibited vehicle at the front gate and unload a delivery and transport it to their residence using their personal vehicle. Please note that emergency, fuel, utility company, USPS, UPS, and CLCA Maintenance vehicles are exempt from road bans. Delivery of your lawn tractor in February or March does not constitute an emergency delivery. Do not attempt to circumvent bans by meeting trucks at the member entrance and permitting entry with your gate card or buzzing them in via the guest gate. All deliveries and guests are to use the main entrance. This is clearly posted at the member only entrance and applies all year round. Parties will be held liable for any damage caused to the road by unauthorized vehicles and a trespassing violation will be issued. If you have any questions regarding road bans, please contact the office. Thank you for your cooperation.",

Although we are a private Community we are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. They have full access to the Community and do come in to enforce rules including but not limited to possession of fishing licenses and boat safety equipment. Be aware of life jacket and safety equipment that is required when on the water. All children 12 years of age and younger on all Commonwealth waters must wear a life jacket while underway on any boat 20 feet in length or less and on all canoes and kayaks. Underway includes drifting boats. For boating and fishing rules please visit https:www.fishandboat.com Pagesdefault.aspx Dont be fooled by a warm beautiful day, especially in the spring and fall. Water temps are still frigid. Cold water can kill quickly. You can be a great swimmer but you cannot swim when overcome by hypothermia. Life jackets are required to be worn by all between November 1 through April 30th when on a boat 16 feet or less and all canoes and kayaks. Although we are not in ice season, it will come soon enough. For information on ice safety visit, https:www.fishandboat. comFishFishingPages IceWinterFishing.aspx Dear Friends and Neighbors of CLCA, Please be aware that any comments made on the Residents FB page are opinions and not always factual. This page unfortunately often presents itself as a gossip column depicting derrogatory remarks and paints our community in a negative connotation. As we still live in the USA and freedom of speech is a right granted to all citizens, we, members of the Board, elected by you, the community, have no means of putting an end to this banter. However, we are obliged to inform you of the many false accusations being made due to some incorrect interpretations of actual truths. We implore you to please refer to the official CLCA FB page as well as the beautiful web site created for all of us when you are searching for information. We welcome all members to attend the membership meetings held the second Saturday of every month at 10:30 am in the Rec building. Please remember that the Board members are merely elected volunteers who often have to make tough decisions which affect all members as we too live here and have a vested interest in our community and property values. We too have jobs and families to care for and make the time to assure a positive outcome for the greater good of our community. We do not receive any compensation, monitarily or otherwise for our efforts as decisions affect us the same as the rest of the members of CLCA, nor do we have any hidden agenda. We welcome your opinions and constructive critisms in a non accusatory manner. We thank you for your time.",

FAQ: For many of our new members and for those who may have forgotten. Q: Why didnt I see association information on the FaceBook page, or where can I see official announcements by Conashaugh Lakes Community Association? A: There are three FaceBook pages generally recognized in Conashaugh Lakes. The official page is named Conashaugh Lakes Community Association and the others are Residents Conashaugh Lakes Community; and Residents of Conashaugh Lakes Unofficial. The official page is used by the administration to notify our membership of events, weather conditions, compactor hours, special announcements and such. The Residents pages are used as a forum for our members to sell items, answer new members questions about locating services in our area, commenting their pleasure or displeasure as to events, Board decisions and Administration procedures. The Administration does not use the Residents page for any announcements. Members will at times share a post from the official page to the Residents Page. It is always good to check the official page when you are on FaceBook to see the administrations posts. Q: Why do the Board of Directors have special privileges, like having keys to take their garbage to the compactors any time they want? A: The Conashaugh Lakes Community Associations Board of Directors as all Boards for Not-For-Profit Corporations are precluded by law from having any special privileges due to their positions. They are no different from any other member except that they volunteer their time and assume a fiduciary responsibility There can be legal ramifications to the Board member for malfeasance to keep our community safe and fiscally positive. Q: I pay my dues, why cant I drop off my garbage any time I want. A: Conashaugh Lakes Community Association offers garbage disposal as one of its amenities. On average it costs Conashaugh Lakes 100.00 of your dues total per year to pay for disposal. This does vary a few dollars each year due to changing pricing by our waste management Companys annual contracts. This is much less that what it would cost our members to contract their own garbage pickup, which would be limited to one day a week and by bag count. Our schedule of hours was voted on at the same time the members of Conashaugh Lakes voted to move the compactors to the front entrance. The compactors schedule is at times modified, usually due to holidays, weather and personnel availability, which has been affected by Covid. This administration will always try to make up any lost hours when possible.",

The next step will be for the Land Development Plan to be presented to the Dingman Township Planning Commission. The date will be communicated when scheduled. The Board of Directors is also reviewing new Trash Compactor Units for the new trash compactor area. The plan is to have the existing trash Compactor units decommissioned after the new trash compactor area is complete and operational. The existing compactor units are 18 years old and the cost to refurbish would be more than half the cost of new units. Also, the new compactors being considered are self- contained units to mitigate any environmental impact.

The next step will be for the Land Development Plan to be presented to the Dingman Township Planning Commission. The date will be communicated when scheduled. The Board of Directors is also reviewing new Trash Compactor Units for the new trash compactor area. The plan is to have the existing trash Compactor units decommissioned after the new trash compactor area is complete and operational. The existing compactor units are 18 years old and the cost to refurbish would be more than half the cost of new units. Also, the new compactors being considered are self- contained units to mitigate any environmental impact.

These bans are to protect 1 Whats Happening in Conashaugh Lakes A newsletter featuring committee updates, community events and things happening in and around the area that our residents may have an interest in. February 7, 2023 our roads from damage during thaw periods. We are permitted a total of eight weeks for the bans. As we have seen, we can experience freezing temperatures in December and then spring-like weather in January. Road bans are determined by the weather conditions. For example, we could get a strong thaw in February where a ban will be placed and then it is followed by a deep freeze which could then put the ban on hold. Maintenance personnel inspection the roads and weather conditions and advise when to institute the ban. How are we notified?

Security Information Direct Number 570 - 832 - 5660 The bylaws of our community states that the Security and Enforcement Committee is responsible for developing ways to provide security to our community as well as making sure that rules and regulations are enforced. The most common complaint that we see and hear from our residents is that drivers in our community are not obeying our traffic laws; particularly in regards to stop signs and speed limits. Our traffic laws are just like those of other communities all around us. To help deter these traffic issues our safety officers not only use radar as stated by the sign at our entrance, but also position themselves near the most violated stop signs. There are no other objectives for these actions other than to reinforce to our residents the importance of obeying standard traffic laws. In fact, for the last few month most of the citations have been warnings. Again our only objective is to prevent a tragedy on our roads as we have many of 2 March 7, 2023 our residents walking in our community and most of our children walking home from school. It should also be noted that these traffic stops are only a small part of our officers daily tours. They also do requested house checks, wellness checks, directing traffic in the parking lot when school buses are there, responding to resident complaints and issues along with doing their regular driving routes. All this is done with part time security. Remember for security issues after hours or medical issues the first call should always be 911. Please drive safely!

This years community picnic is in the books! Thank you to all of the members and guests who attended. A huge THANK YOU to the Recreation Committee, Maintenance Department, our Administration and office staff, Board members, and volunteers who made it possible. The weather was great, the food was plentiful and the company was wonderful! Each year we strive to provide a picnic that our community wants. In order to do that, we want your feedback! If you attended the picnic, let us know what you enjoyed or didnt, and what you would like to see added or changed for next year. If you didnt attend, what do we have to do to get you there next year? Please email your comments and suggestion to clcarecreationgmail.com. One of the biggest obstacles to the Recreation Committee is finding volunteers to help with this and all of our other events. Actually, it is an obstacle for all of our committees. We are an association that is volunteer-run. Each year there are numerous events hosted by our various committees. Every committee is always looking for new members. If you are interested in being a part of any of our committees, sit in on a meeting and see if it is for you. All are welcome!

We hope it has been great for all of you, and that this monthly update finds you well and enjoying the sunshine. We have had a busy, fun-filled summer here in Conashaugh Lakes. We had our annual picnic that we hope you enjoyed, and the kids pool party was a great time for all who attended. We also had our book club meetings as well was our Murder Mystery Wine nights that were a hit. There is still plenty of Summer to enjoy, but some of the committees are looking ahead to the holidays. This year we will be hosting an Angel Tree to offer help to those in the community who may be struggling to give their family the holiday magic that keeps the innocent wonder of the season glowing.

My name is Kurt Budveit. As of the Yearly Reorganization Meeting, immediately following the Membership Meeting on September 30, 2023, I have been appointed to the position of CLCA Board President for the Fall 2023 through Fall 2024 term. I have been a member of this community for 22 years. I have been part of the Rules  Regulations Committee, and the Design  Review Com- mittee; along with periods being Board Liaison to both for many years now. As your new CLCA Board President, I look forward to continuing my service to this community, and will do my part for it to remain a great place to live, without too many restrictions or unnecessary expense; keep- ing dues low during hard economic times and high inflation. Respectfully, Kurt Budveit CLCA Board President THE CONASHAUGH COURI ER What  s New Amongst Our Board Of Directors? Due to current climate, the board decided to reorganize a number of things for efficiency  s purpose. 1 is to shift our Members Meetings to quarterly format, and 2 is to give each Committee the right to have an individual schedule conducive to what projects need to be worked on andor researched, etc. Some Committees may decide to offer meetings monthly, depending on the consistency of projects coming in; such as Design  Review tentative, or Security. Some may decide to split the Committee  s Volunteer Responsibilities between a Open Member Meetings for all CLCA members for discussions, and b Workshops for Committee members only to have research and idea write - ups for possible vote andor approval by the Board at our open meet- ings; such as Rules  Regulations. This will leave more time to focus on Member  s Meetings for notes and ideas to bring to the board; and workshops for Committee members to actually focus and start the process of getting ideas researched and ready for the boards discussion or vote; without the sometimes negative environment and distractions of an open meeting. So, please check monthly for meeting  workshop specifics; See tentative schedules to follow. 3 Committees were originally advised by our attorney to have all Committees have confidentially agreements signed by all members. A change to this has also been decided at our reorganization meeting; depending on the need, Committees are being given the opportunity to make own guide- lines on this topic. Our biggest issues are where Child Welfare, Members Privacy, and False Speculations are concerned; Each Committee putting forth if they will require it, and specifically, for what Technical Term: Non Profit Data Security. This will be brought up for final publicly viewed board vote in December, to be added to CLCA Bluebook. See current Confidentiality Requirement table to follow. Full Transparency will be a priority for Membership  Board Meeting Discussions, and Voting, which is what needs to be done to keep our community financially stable, active, and progressing. Looking toward the future, this  What  s New  section will be used to update the community on new board business, and articles on topics and  or current situations members should be kept up to date on. This is just the beginning. Moving forward, we hope you will find the New  Conashaugh Courier  Newsletter helpful in keeping you informed on community matters, and some of the current ques- tions circling the CLCA community.

October 2023 Security Camera Update The Board of Directors, Administrator and Security Committee is pleased to announce that work has begun to replace our outdated and malfunctioning camera system. The present system requires us to go to 3 locations to review anything that has been recorded and is very time - consuming if the video needs to be reviewed. The new replacement system will start with 18 cameras and can be expanded up to 32 if needed in the future. There will be 4 color IP network cameras with automatic license plate capabilities installed by both of our en- trance gates. The remaining are 8mp color cameras that contain AI object recognition and will be installed at our rec. center, pool area, maintenance yard, security booth overlooking our bus and office parking lot, present compactor area, mailbox and recycling bin areas. When our new compactor area is completed the recycling area cameras can easily be relocated to cover that new area. The network video recorder and hard drive sys- tems with live and 14 - day recording capabilities will allow us save any video we may need to. Best of all we will be able monitor and store videos in one place. These cameras are installed by a professional company that was chosen out of 3 companies for not only their competitive price, but also their reliability and quick response to any questions we had during the vetting pro- cess. This new camera system installation also includes approximately 40 hours of training, a 2 - year warranty on cameras and will also allow for remote viewing if needed, particularly on weekends. We will also be entering into a service agreement that will give us software updates, training and discounted repair visits if needed. This camera system will serve us well into the future and will help keeping our community safer. Fall Road Safety Tips from our Security Committee Fellow Residents, Now that fall is in full swing, the Security Committee has some reminders for you. With the leaves beginning to fall, our roads may be slippery, especially in the mornings with the combination of those fallen leaves along with the fresh morning dew or after a rainstorm. There will also be more of a sun glare depending on the hours of the day; particularly during the early morning and late afternoon drive time. We ask that you please slow down, not only for your own safety, but for the safety of our community members. Please give plenty of room to our walkers and bike riders. Don  t make an injury or possibly a death be the final reason we all slow down. We also want to remind you please do not blow your leaves into our roadways. The leaves are beautiful to look at, but not on our roadways. Lets keep them on our grassy areas, out of the flow of traffic. To sum it all up, just slow down, take a breath and enjoy the beautiful colors that this fall season has brought to our community! October 2023",

As of the Yearly Reorganization Meeting, immediately following the Membership Meeting on September 30, 2023, I have been appointed to the position of CLCA Board President for the Fall 2023 through Fall 2024 term. I have been a member of this community for 22 years.

As your new CLCA Board President, I look forward to continuing my service to this community, and will do my part for it to remain a great place to live, without too many restrictions or unnecessary expense; keep- ing dues low during hard economic times and high inflation. Respectfully, Kurt Budveit CLCA Board President THE CONASHAUGH COURI ER",

        "content": "What  s New Amongst Our Board Of Directors? Due to current climate, the board decided to reorganize a number of things for efficiency  s purpose. 1 is to shift our Members Meetings to quarterly format, and 2 is to give each Committee the right to have an individual schedule conducive to what projects need to be worked on andor researched, etc. Some Committees may decide to offer meetings monthly, depending on the consistency of projects coming in; such as Design  Review tentative, or Security. Some may decide to split the Committee  s Volunteer Responsibilities between a Open Member Meetings for all CLCA members for discussions, and b Workshops for Committee members only to have research and idea write - ups for possible vote andor approval by the Board at our open meet- ings; such as Rules  Regulations. This will leave more time to focus on Member  s Meetings for notes and ideas to bring to the board; and workshops for Committee members to actually focus and start the process of getting ideas researched and ready for the boards discussion or vote; without the sometimes negative environment and distractions of an open meeting. So, please check monthly for meeting  workshop specifics; See tentative schedules to follow. 3 Committees were originally advised by our attorney to have all Committees have confidentially agreements signed by all members. A change to this has also been decided at our reorganization meeting; depending on the need, Committees are being given the opportunity to make own guide- lines on this topic. Our biggest issues are where Child Welfare, Members Privacy, and False Speculations are concerned; Each Committee putting forth if they will require it, and specifically, for what Technical Term: Non Profit Data Security. This will be brought up for final publicly viewed board vote in December, to be added to CLCA Bluebook. See current Confidentiality Requirement table to follow. Full Transparency will be a priority for Membership  Board Meeting Discussions, and Voting, which is what needs to be done to keep our community financially stable, active, and progressing. Looking toward the future, this  What  s New  section will be used to update the community on new board business, and articles on topics and  or current situations members should be kept up to date on. This is just the beginning. Moving forward, we hope you will find the New  Conashaugh Courier  Newsletter helpful in keeping you informed on community matters, and some of the current ques- tions circling the CLCA community. Sincerely, Conashaugh Lakes Community Association Board of Directors October 2023",

        "content": "Security Camera Update The Board of Directors, Administrator and Security Committee is pleased to announce that work has begun to replace our outdated and malfunctioning camera system. The present system requires us to go to 3 locations to review anything that has been recorded and is very time - consuming if the video needs to be reviewed. The new replacement system will start with 18 cameras and can be expanded up to 32 if needed in the future. There will be 4 color IP network cameras with automatic license plate capabilities installed by both of our en- trance gates. The remaining are 8mp color cameras that contain AI object recognition and will be installed at our rec. center, pool area, maintenance yard, security booth overlooking our bus and office parking lot, present compactor area, mailbox and recycling bin areas. When our new compactor area is completed the recycling area cameras can easily be relocated to cover that new area. The network video recorder and hard drive sys- tems with live and 14 - day recording capabilities will allow us save any video we may need to. Best of all we will be able monitor and store videos in one place. These cameras are installed by a professional company that was chosen out of 3 companies for not only their competitive price, but also their reliability and quick response to any questions we had during the vetting pro- cess. This new camera system installation also includes approximately 40 hours of training, a 2 - year warranty on cameras and will also allow for remote viewing if needed, particularly on weekends. We will also be entering into a service agreement that will give us software updates, training and discounted repair visits if needed. This camera system will serve us well into the future and will help keeping our community safer. Fall Road Safety Tips from our Security Committee Fellow Residents, Now that fall is in full swing, the Security Committee has some reminders for you. With the leaves beginning to fall, our roads may be slippery, especially in the mornings with the combination of those fallen leaves along with the fresh morning dew or after a rainstorm. There will also be more of a sun glare depending on the hours of the day; particularly during the early morning and late afternoon drive time. We ask that you please slow down, not only for your own safety, but for the safety of our community members. Please give plenty of room to our walkers and bike riders. Don  t make an injury or possibly a death be the final reason we all slow down. We also want to remind you please do not blow your leaves into our roadways. The leaves are beautiful to look at, but not on our roadways. Lets keep them on our grassy areas, out of the flow of traffic. To sum it all up, just slow down, take a breath and enjoy the beautiful colors that this fall season has brought to our community! October 2023",

If you are using the USPS INFORMED DELIVERY MAIL Phone APP, kindly visit the following link explaining how it does and sometimes does not work, www.usglobalmail.comusps-informed- delivery-not-working-what-to-do There have been concerns expressed by members who have been notified through the app that certain mail and packages will be delivered but find the expected deliveries are not in their box, Answers to these and other questions can be found on the link. As a friendly reminder, please avoid interrupting the mail carrier to ask why your mail is on your app and not in your mailbox. We have over 500 homes in our Community that are serviced by USPS.

Thank you, Trash Compactor Relocation Project Status The Land Development Plan for the new Trash Compactor Area is in progress and will be presented to the Board of Directors once it is completed. The next step will be for the Land Development Plan to be presented to the Dingman Township Planning Commission. The date will be communicated when scheduled. The Board of Directors is also reviewing new Trash Compactor Units for the new trash compactor area. The plan is to have the existing trash Compactor units decommissioned after the new trash compactor area is complete and operational. The existing compactor units are 18 years old and the cost to refurbish would be more than half the cost of new units. Also, one of the new compactors being considered are self-contained units to mitigate any environmental impact. The total number of new compactors will be three; two for trash and one for recycling.

CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2023 PAGE 8 PAGE 7 CLCA NEWS Please Pick Up After Your Dog As the old saying goes, it is better to rule from the bottom up than rule from the top down. What does that mean? Example, there is no rule that members have to pick up after their dogs. Its something that is the right thing to do and common sense if not courtesy. No one finds joy scraping your dogs feculence from their shoes or kids toys. No one wants to be hassled by security asking to see your bags, right? Thats just annoying. So save a lot of aggravation all around and pick up after your dog, please. Thank you. Reminder The PA Boat and Fish requires from November 1 through April 30th that life jackets be worn by all occupants of boats 16 feet long or less and all canoes and kayaks. Dont let even the warmest spring day fool you into believing water temperatures have warmed. Cold water shock can kill in seconds. Please wear a life jacket. All waterways including ours are under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Boat and Fish Commission. For water and ice safety information you can visit their website at www.fishandboat.comBoatWaterandIceSafetyPagesdefault.aspx CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2023 CONASHAUGH COURIER  WINTER 2023 PAGE 9 pain, tingling, burning, weakness, or numbness in arms, hands, legs or feet sudden, sharp, stabbing or shocking pain sensations loss of touch sensation clumsiness and trouble using hands to pick up objects or fasten clothing loss of balance and falling The most common symptoms include: For some, their nerves will recover over time. For most, the nerve damage is irreversible. Elliott had been told just that by a series of doctors and specialists. Essentially they could cure his cancer but couldnt fix the damage done by the drugs used to cure his cancer. Then Elliott made a call to acupuncturist Olivia Niedbala, L.Ac. of Pike Acupuncture  Wellness right here in Milford. This clinic is using the time tested science of Acupuncture and technology originally developed by NASA that assists in increasing blood flow and expediting healing to treat this debilitating disease. After a series of treatments, Elliott was taking stairs with stride! We have a split level and our bedroom is upstairs. This morning I walked right down the stairs and got in the car, Elliot shared. Finally! A local Acupuncturist is helping cancer survivors live lives free from the constant pain and suffering associated with Peripheral Neuropathy! ITS LIFE CHANGING Irreversible is not a word you want to hear from your Doctor but its a common one if youve been diagnosed with Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy or CIPN. Elliott S. of Dingmans Ferry survived testicular cancer only to be living life in constant pain. He felt as though he were walking on pins and needles, becoming weaker and weaker every day. I was beginning to be worried that one day I would be wheelchair-bound. Nearly half of the patients who undergo chemotherapy will develop Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy or CIPN. Chemotherapy meds travel throughout the body and attack cancer cells. Sadly, they can also cause severe damage to healthy nerves. CIPN can begin within weeks of starting treatment and can worsen as treatment continues. A high number of really unfortunate people will be forced to endure the symptoms associated with CIPN for months or even years after theyve completed chemo. When asked how CIPN was affecting his quality of life, he responded, It was difficult to even walk up and down stairs and do other things we usually take for granted. I remember thinking thats become mighty easy for me, I didnt have to hold on to the hand rail or anything! Its life changing to have this mobility back! Again and again, we meet with patients who were once diagnosed as untreatable or incurable but after receiving treatments at Pike Acupuncture  Wellness are now living lives free from pain and suffering. For years, Olivia Niedbala, L.Ac has been reversing the effects of CIPN and other varieties of Peripheral Neuropathy, including that caused by diabetes, without invasive surgeries and medications that come with uncomfortable side effects. If youve recently beat cancer only to find that youre living a life in constant pain and discomfort, or youre struggling with the same symptoms as a result of either Idiopathic Neuropathy or Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy, Olivia Niedbala, L.Ac and the incredible team at Pike Acupuncture  Wellness can help! Pike Acupuncture  Wellness is now accepting a limited number of new patients. Call 570 832-8600 now to schedule your consultation, and get one step closer to taking your life back from Peripheral Neuropathy!

The plan is to have the existing trash Compactor units decommissioned after the new trash compactor area is complete and operational. The existing compactor units are 18 years old and the cost to refurbish would be more than half the cost of new units. Also, one of the new compactors being considered are self-contained units to mitigate any environmental impact. The total number of new compactors will be three; two for trash and one for recycling. Monthly updates on the Compactor Project will be provided in the CLCA Monthly Newsletter located at Newsletters  Conashaugh Lakes Community Association If you have any questions, please email them to clcaboardconashaughlakes. com and they will be addressed at the Monthly Membership meeting and will also be provided in the CLCA Monthly Newsletter.",

What does that mean? Example, there is no rule that members have to pick up after their dogs. Its something that is the right thing to do and common sense if not courtesy. No one finds joy scraping your dogs feculence from their shoes or kids toys. No one wants to be hassled by security asking to see your bags, right? Thats just annoying. So save a lot of aggravation all around and pick up after your dog, please. Thank you.

For most, the nerve damage is irreversible. Elliott had been told just that by a series of doctors and specialists. Essentially they could cure his cancer but couldnt fix the damage done by the drugs used to cure his cancer. Then Elliott made a call to acupuncturist Olivia Niedbala, L.Ac. of Pike Acupuncture  Wellness right here in Milford. This clinic is using the time tested science of Acupuncture and technology originally developed by NASA that assists in increasing blood flow and expediting healing to treat this debilitating disease. After a series of treatments, Elliott was taking stairs with stride! We have a split level and our bedroom is upstairs. This morning I walked right down the stairs and got in the car, Elliot shared. Finally! A local Acupuncturist is helping cancer survivors live lives free from the constant pain and suffering associated with Peripheral Neuropathy! ITS LIFE CHANGING Irreversible is not a word you want to hear from your Doctor but its a common one if youve been diagnosed with Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy or CIPN. Elliott S. of Dingmans Ferry survived testicular cancer only to be living life in constant pain. He felt as though he were walking on pins and needles, becoming weaker and weaker every day. I was beginning to be worried that one day I would be wheelchair-bound. Nearly half of the patients who undergo chemotherapy will develop Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy or CIPN. Chemotherapy meds travel throughout the body and attack cancer cells. Sadly, they can also cause severe damage to healthy nerves. CIPN can begin within weeks of starting treatment and can worsen as treatment continues. A high number of really unfortunate people will be forced to endure the symptoms associated with CIPN for months or even years after theyve completed chemo. When asked how CIPN was affecting his quality of life, he responded, It was difficult to even walk up and down stairs and do other things we usually take for granted. I remember thinking thats become mighty easy for me, I didnt have to hold on to the hand rail or anything! Its life changing to have this mobility back! Again and again, we meet with patients who were once diagnosed as untreatable or incurable but after receiving treatments at Pike Acupuncture  Wellness are now living lives free from pain and suffering. For years, Olivia Niedbala, L.Ac has been reversing the effects of CIPN and other varieties of Peripheral Neuropathy, including that caused by diabetes, without invasive surgeries and medications that come with uncomfortable side effects. If youve recently beat cancer only to find that youre living a life in constant pain and discomfort, or youre struggling with the same symptoms as a result of either Idiopathic Neuropathy or Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy, Olivia Niedbala, L.Ac and the incredible team at Pike Acupuncture  Wellness can help! Pike Acupuncture  Wellness is now accepting a limited number of new patients. Call 570 832-8600 now to schedule your consultation, and get one step closer to taking your life back from Peripheral Neuropathy!

The Board of Directors would like to wish all of our residents the happiest of new years. We look forward to exciting times as we continue our efforts to make Conashaugh Lakes a wonderful place to live. We as a Board would like to say thank you for all you do to help make our neighborhood a wonderful place to live. We appreciate the support of so many of you and do try our best to do what is in the best interest of all homeowners. Best of luck for the new year. The Conashaugh Lakes Community Newsletter Winter is Just Getting Started The following are some gentle reminders about snow cleanup in our community. Snow and Weather Events: We are fully prepared for winter weather and will continue to pro- vide the same snow cleanup that has been done in the past; as quickly and safely as possi- ble. Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. We would like to re- mind all residents that cars should not be parked on the street or in front of driveways dur- ing snow removal. Doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of dam- age to your vehicle. We are aware that there are some driveways that have a slope making it difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. We ask that you please park your vehicle at least a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road when we are expecting snow. When plowing your own driveways or cleaning your vehicles, please do not throw snow into the streets. Doing so is subject to Safety Violation fines. All property owners using private con- tractors to remove snow are responsible for alerting them of this regulation. Please keep kids and pets safe by not allowing them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Power outages: During a power outage all of the entry and exit gates go into the up position. The gates have backup batteries that allow for this to happen instead of staying in the down position. The gates can not be manually lifted or operated without power. Once power is re- stored the gates will return to the down position. Also note the compactors cannot operate without power, therefore they will be closed. Please hold trash until the power is restored and the compactors can be reopened. Do not leave trash outside the gate or throw it in the recycle bins. Best wishes for a spectacular New Year! January 2024 VehicleInformation Update It is important to keep information for vehicles registered to your property updated. Members who have added, sold, junked or replaced a vehicle that is registered at the office need to noti- fy the office. Spot checks of gate card usage are conducted. If a vehicle using a gate card does not match the information in the office, you risk having your gate card deactivated. Members may request a printout of cards and vehicles registered to their property by sending an email to adminassistantconashaughlakes.com. The process for updating vehicles has been sim- plified and can be done via email. This also goes for email addresses and mobile phone num- ber changes. The office should have current and up to date information for all residents. This information is used to contact you andor have you receive informational updates. Thank you. Decorating Contest Thank you to the members who participated in this years holiday decorating contest: 1161 Route 739, 133 Oneida Way, 297 Seneca Drive, 1155 Route 739, 103 Seneca Court, and 101 Flatbrook Court. There were homes that were decorated in such a way that you could look at them every day and see something new that you didn  t notice before. They truly brought holi- day joy to all who saw them. There were so many other homes that were decorated so nicely; they should really consider being part of this contest next year!

The Board of Directors would like to wish all of our residents the happiest of new years. We look forward to exciting times as we continue our efforts to make Conashaugh Lakes a wonderful place to live. We as a Board would like to say thank you for all you do to help make our neighborhood a wonderful place to live. We appreciate the support of so many of you and do try our best to do what is in the best interest of all homeowners. Best of luck for the new year. The Conashaugh Lakes Community Newsletter Winter is Just Getting Started The following are some gentle reminders about snow cleanup in our community. Snow and Weather Events: We are fully prepared for winter weather and will continue to pro- vide the same snow cleanup that has been done in the past; as quickly and safely as possi- ble. Please note that overnight parking on CLCA roads is not permitted. We would like to re- mind all residents that cars should not be parked on the street or in front of driveways dur- ing snow removal. Doing so creates a hazard to our maintenance workers and a risk of dam- age to your vehicle. We are aware that there are some driveways that have a slope making it difficult to exit and enter with ice and snow. We ask that you please park your vehicle at least a minimum of four feet from the edge of the road when we are expecting snow. When plowing your own driveways or cleaning your vehicles, please do not throw snow into the streets. Doing so is subject to Safety Violation fines. All property owners using private con- tractors to remove snow are responsible for alerting them of this regulation. Please keep kids and pets safe by not allowing them to play on or near snow banks along the roads. Power outages: During a power outage all of the entry and exit gates go into the up position. The gates have backup batteries that allow for this to happen instead of staying in the down position. The gates can not be manually lifted or operated without power. Once power is re- stored the gates will return to the down position. Also note the compactors cannot operate without power, therefore they will be closed. Please hold trash until the power is restored and the compactors can be reopened. Do not leave trash outside the gate or throw it in the recycle bins. Best wishes for a spectacular New Year!",

The process for updating vehicles has been sim- plified and can be done via email. This also goes for email addresses and mobile phone num- ber changes. The office should have current and up to date information for all residents. This information is used to contact you andor have you receive informational updates. Thank you. Decorating Contest Thank you to the members who participated in this years holiday decorating contest: 1161 Route 739, 133 Oneida Way, 297 Seneca Drive, 1155 Route 739, 103 Seneca Court, and 101 Flatbrook Court. There were homes that were decorated in such a way that you could look at them every day and see something new that you didn  t notice before. They truly brought holi- day joy to all who saw them. There were so many other homes that were decorated so nicely; they should really consider being part of this contest next year! Congratulations to 297 Seneca Drive, 1155 Route 739, and 101 Flatbrook Court. Great job done by all!

While the Board of Directors is aware that some members believe the Board should hire a HOA Management Company, the Board is not planning to consider contracting with an outside management company. What are the reasons why?  Cost and reliability  Member  s personal information not being distributed across multiple service providers.  We are a small HOA  Self - management works for smaller communities because the size makes them more manageable and saves money.  Larger HOA  s may benefit when the cost of utilizing a HOA Management Company is scalable and there are many competitive local service providers for a HOA Management Company to utilize.  We have a very dedicated team of staff that maintains daily operations, knows our community, and has been dedicated to our community with a combined 75 plus years of experience.  Our staff performs daily activities that a HOA Management Company would outsource to service providers. Service provider contracts may cost more. If service providers have constrained resources at times this could impact the main services to our community. One service that immediately comes to mind is road maintenance  plowing our 28 miles of roads quickly in the winter, quickly removing a downed tree blocking a road, or other road obstruction.  Our Association has an outside Certified Public Accountant for an annual independent audit of our books and records. Our Certified Public Accountant also provides accounting and financial recommendations.  Our Association has an outside Attorney for Association legal matters.  The Association already has outside contracts for security and trash removal.  Service contract costs can increase each year as we have seen historically even with competitive pricing.

The Association  s Bylaws define the authority for disbursement of funds for paying Association expenses and for the management of investments and maintaining reserves. The Conashaugh Lakes Community Newsletter February 2024 The Importance of Leash Laws in HOA  s Living in a community means sharing our spaces with others, including our beloved pets. As much as we cherish our furry companions, responsible pet ownership becomes paramount to maintaining harmony and safety within homeowners  associations. One essential aspect of responsible pet ownership is adhering to dog leash laws, which ensure the well - being of both dogs and humans. Safety is at the heart of any well - functioning community. Dog leash laws serve as a fundamental safeguard, protecting community members from potential dog - related incidents. Leash laws contribute to an atmosphere of tranquility and order by preventing dogs from causing dis- turbances such as digging up gardens, defecating on public or private property, or disrupting traffic flow. Re- sponsible pet owners play a pivotal role in upholding these laws, ensuring their pet  s behavior does not adverse- ly affect their neighbors or the community as a whole. Unleashed dogs can inadvertently disturb and harm our delicate ecosystems. By keeping dogs on leashes, residents uphold a commitment to preserving local fauna, al- lowing the harmonious coexistence of wildlife and community life. Every resident deserves to feel comfortable and safe in their community. Upholding these laws nurtures a welcoming and inclusive environment, where eve- ryone can coexist harmoniously.

The reason for this is the mailbox area has constantly flowing traffic which makes it an unsafe area for the children to walk through. The main bus lot has a safety routine that all drivers who are there for the bus are familiar with. The vehicles are not directed out until the monitor sees all children are safe from the moving cars and then they proceed with caution. This routine only adds another two minutes to your wait time, but will ensure the safety of all.

Note From a Neighbor Attention Conashaugh Seniors, Are you on Social Security? Do you realize you are paying Federal Income Tax on your Social Security benefits? There is a bill in Congress H.R. 7084 to repeal the Federal tax on Social Security Benefits. I would suggest that you contact Congressman Matt Cartwright and urge him to actively support H. R. 7084 and get it passed this year. I would also suggest that you contact Senator Bob Casey and urge him to submit a similar bill in the Senate and actively support it. Remember, we paid Federal Taxes on Social Security when we were working. Please help get this unfair Federal Income Tax repealed.

Note From a Neighbor Attention Conashaugh Seniors, Are you on Social Security? Do you realize you are paying Federal Income Tax on your Social Security benefits? There is a bill in Congress H.R. 7084 to repeal the Federal tax on Social Security Benefits. I would suggest that you contact Congressman Matt Cartwright and urge him to actively support H. R. 7084 and get it passed this year. I would also suggest that you contact Senator Bob Casey and urge him to submit a similar bill in the Senate and actively support it. Remember, we paid Federal Taxes on Social Security when we were working. Please help get this unfair Federal Income Tax repealed. Thank you, Your neighbor Tom Nelson",

Fines collected during June total 215.00, year to date collection of fines totals 2,615.00 Summer Edition JuneJuly 2024 Office Restoration Clarification There have been repeated posts on social media over the past two years re- garding money spent to  redecorate  the office. The posts imply to the reader that the office restoration was a choice over paving the parking lot and building a bus shelter. For the record, it was not a choice over any other project. The fol- lowing is an article about the project that was published in the 2022 Winter Is- sue of our past official publication, the Conashaugh Courier. The original article can be found on our website under the Community Info tab CLCA News. It should be noted that the amount approved for purchasing materials needed to complete this project was 10,000.00 and the total amount spent on those mate- rials was 6384.86. The budget granted for materials was approved in August 2021 with the condition that the purchases be made by the end of the 20202021 financial year or September 30, 2021. CLCA OFFICE FINALLY GETTING A FACELIFT Over the past couple of years, the Board discussed the need for a new or expanded office. Past requests to paint the existing space were tabled with that possibility. Due to the unlike- lihood that a new or expanded office was happening in the near future, the Board was again approached to paint the office in August 2021 at which time a discussion ensued and the re- alization of a need for more than painting was agreed. The Board passed a motion in August 2021 to allow up 10,000.00 for improvements which includes painting of the interior office, new desks, window coverings and new flooring and lighting fixtures in the lobby. The office is the gateway to our Community and although it is closed to public traffic due to COVID concerns at this time, it will eventually reopen. When it does reopen we wish for it to be a welcoming, updated environment for our members and guests. Our employees are also deserving of a good work environment. The office was last painted in 2007 by non - paid volunteers. Most of the office furniture was picked from dumpster day events. Curtains are hand - me - downs as well as the seating in the reception area. Capital improvements such as a deck, new windows, main entry door, electric baseboard and electric panels were addressed following the 2007 painting. To keep costs down, the work is being completed by staff and volunteers. As of this writing a majority of the materials and equipment have been purchased for 6,400.00. Expected future costs will be minimal. There has been concern expressed about the budget for this project. Although COVID is not known to provide a lot of benefits, our Community was fortunate to reap one. Due to the surge in property sales following the onset of COVID our Community received additional in- come to effect this project. No money was removed from reserves or normal operating in- come. There will be no requests, surcharges, levied to our members to pay for the cost of this project. Summer Edition JuneJuly 2024 The Facts About The Swan Story The Canadian Geese are a menace. They excrete up to three pounds of excrement each per day. When geese defecate near shore or in the water, they create a health risk to hu- mans and pets. A larger concern are fecal bacteria, or Escherichia coli E. coli, which are naturally occurring bacteria in the digestive tracts of warm - blooded animals. E. coli, when present in large amounts, may cause gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomit- ing, and diarrhea. The presence of E. coli may also indicate the potential presence of oth- er pathogenic organisms. Within two weeks after the arrival of the Canadian Geese this year, the shorelines of Sen- e c a L a k e a n d B e a v e r P o n d w e r e a c a r p e t o f g e e s e e x c r e m e n t. M y c o m m i t t e e a n d I b e g a n searching for natural ways to discourage them from returning here. We have a Federal Permit to control the geese and to addle the eggs. We are always looking for natural means to control the geese. Many towns and cities in Northeast United States have re- sorted to fatal solutions which includes corralling the geese and gassing them. The company that inspects and tests the water quality of our lakes knew we were looking for natural solutions to control the geese. Swans were one of the suggestions made at an Environmental Committee meeting earlier this year. Swans are a very effective natural so- lution for deterring Canadian Geese. A local veterinarian was raising 2 male swan siblings whose wings have been clipped. He was trying to find a home for them. We needed a member of our community to raise them for a few months until they were old enough to go out on Seneca Lake. Yes, Swans do poop, however there would only be two of them. Unlike geese, swans do not eat con- stantly, they feed until they are full and they stop, therefore there is much less poop from swans. Two swans, verses forty plus geese is a lot less poop. Being that they are male and siblings they would not mate. Dispute the misinformation of how angry and aggres- sive swans are, this would only be in mates who were nesting or raising singlets.

        "content": "Summer Edition JuneJuly 2024 Office Restoration Clarification There have been repeated posts on social media over the past two years re- garding money spent to  redecorate  the office. The posts imply to the reader that the office restoration was a choice over paving the parking lot and building a bus shelter. For the record, it was not a choice over any other project. The fol- lowing is an article about the project that was published in the 2022 Winter Is- sue of our past official publication, the Conashaugh Courier. The original article can be found on our website under the Community Info tab CLCA News. It should be noted that the amount approved for purchasing materials needed to complete this project was 10,000.00 and the total amount spent on those mate- rials was 6384.86. The budget granted for materials was approved in August 2021 with the condition that the purchases be made by the end of the 20202021 financial year or September 30, 2021. CLCA OFFICE FINALLY GETTING A FACELIFT Over the past couple of years, the Board discussed the need for a new or expanded office. Past requests to paint the existing space were tabled with that possibility. Due to the unlike- lihood that a new or expanded office was happening in the near future, the Board was again approached to paint the office in August 2021 at which time a discussion ensued and the re- alization of a need for more than painting was agreed. The Board passed a motion in August 2021 to allow up 10,000.00 for improvements which includes painting of the interior office, new desks, window coverings and new flooring and lighting fixtures in the lobby. The office is the gateway to our Community and although it is closed to public traffic due to COVID concerns at this time, it will eventually reopen. When it does reopen we wish for it to be a welcoming, updated environment for our members and guests. Our employees are also deserving of a good work environment. The office was last painted in 2007 by non - paid volunteers. Most of the office furniture was picked from dumpster day events. Curtains are hand - me - downs as well as the seating in the reception area. Capital improvements such as a deck, new windows, main entry door, electric baseboard and electric panels were addressed following the 2007 painting. To keep costs down, the work is being completed by staff and volunteers. As of this writing a majority of the materials and equipment have been purchased for 6,400.00. Expected future costs will be minimal. There has been concern expressed about the budget for this project. Although COVID is not known to provide a lot of benefits, our Community was fortunate to reap one. Due to the surge in property sales following the onset of COVID our Community received additional in- come to effect this project. No money was removed from reserves or normal operating in- come. There will be no requests, surcharges, levied to our members to pay for the cost of this project.",

        "content": "Summer Edition JuneJuly 2024 The Facts About The Swan Story The Canadian Geese are a menace. They excrete up to three pounds of excrement each per day. When geese defecate near shore or in the water, they create a health risk to hu- mans and pets. A larger concern are fecal bacteria, or Escherichia coli E. coli, which are naturally occurring bacteria in the digestive tracts of warm - blooded animals. E. coli, when present in large amounts, may cause gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomit- ing, and diarrhea. The presence of E. coli may also indicate the potential presence of oth- er pathogenic organisms. Within two weeks after the arrival of the Canadian Geese this year, the shorelines of Sen- e c a L a k e a n d B e a v e r P o n d w e r e a c a r p e t o f g e e s e e x c r e m e n t. M y c o m m i t t e e a n d I b e g a n searching for natural ways to discourage them from returning here. We have a Federal Permit to control the geese and to addle the eggs. We are always looking for natural means to control the geese. Many towns and cities in Northeast United States have re- sorted to fatal solutions which includes corralling the geese and gassing them. The company that inspects and tests the water quality of our lakes knew we were looking for natural solutions to control the geese. Swans were one of the suggestions made at an Environmental Committee meeting earlier this year. Swans are a very effective natural so- lution for deterring Canadian Geese. A local veterinarian was raising 2 male swan siblings whose wings have been clipped. He was trying to find a home for them. We needed a member of our community to raise them for a few months until they were old enough to go out on Seneca Lake. Yes, Swans do poop, however there would only be two of them. Unlike geese, swans do not eat con- stantly, they feed until they are full and they stop, therefore there is much less poop from swans. Two swans, verses forty plus geese is a lot less poop. Being that they are male and siblings they would not mate. Dispute the misinformation of how angry and aggres- sive swans are, this would only be in mates who were nesting or raising singlets. That is the only known aggression from swans. Swans will deter the Canadian Geese from nest- ing on a body of water and the Canadian Geese would move on and not return to our lake. Before the motion was made to the Board, the Environmental Committee members were asked if they could adopt the swans until they were feathered and able to be independent on the lake. The conversation about the swans was never addressed to the entire community as it was in committee and no conclusions had been made whether we would go forward with the purchase. Unfortunately, an email that had been sent to the Environmental Committee and The Board was forwarded to certain members and misinformation was then distributed to the members via social media.",

This is an opportunity for our members to ask questions to the candidates running for the five open positions on the board. Please email your questions to CLCAboardconashaughlakes.com by August 12th.

This year we have had such a large turnout of interested members who want to sit on the Board of Directors, a Meet The Candidates has been scheduled for Friday, August 30th at 7:00 pm and Sat- urday, August 31st at 10:00 am to be held in the clubhouse. RSVP  s will be required for each day, as the clubhouse can only hold a certain amount of people. There was a separate RSVP email sent out to all of the members. This is an opportunity for our members to ask questions to the candidates running for the five open positions on the board. Please email your questions to CLCAboardconashaughlakes.com by August 12th. This meet up is not for personal attacks, but will focus on general issues, concerns and inquiries from the member submitted questions. We hope you will use this opportunity to get to know all those who are running. Board Member Breakdown The current Board of Directors are Kurt Budveit: President and Design and Review Liaison, Craig Henry: Treasurer and Finance Liaison, Howard Smaller: Maintenance Liaison, Valerie Ferlauto: Board Secretary and Environmental Liaison, Betty Buccine: Communication Liaison, Barbara Chopyk: Strategic Planning Liaison, and Marisa Jara: Recreation Liaison. Kurt Budveit, Betty Buccine, Valerie Ferlauto and Marisa Jara will remain on the Board, as they still have time in their terms to serve. The board has nine members when all seats are filled, currently there are five open seats for the new fiscal year and we have nine members running for those seats. The mem- bers running are current board members Craig Henry, Howard Smaller and Barbara Chopyk, who will be running for the first time on our ballot as they were appointed to the Board. There are al- so members Larry Farnum who was a past board member in 2019, as well as Christina DiBlase, Dawn Lobello, Perry Langbein, Michelle Simonds and Richard Phillips who will be on the ballot for the first time as well. This is the largest turnout of members who have not been previously ap- pointed and go on the ballot afterwards. In years past no new applications have been submitted for open board positions. This year there was a record turnout. Upcoming Annual Board Meeting The annual board meeting has been scheduled for September 28th starting at 9:00 am. It will be held at St. Vincent  s Church. Due to the annual meeting, please remember that we will not have a Membership Meeting in September. October will begin our new fiscal year, and with that comes the reorganization of our committees.

If you receive a citation that you do not agree with or wish to contest the infraction, you may do so within 30 days of receiving the citation in the mail. Please note that the St. Moritz Security management requests that officers do not detain drivers during traffic stops for the purpose of writing tickets. Therefore, the officer will tell you the reason for stopping you, request your docu- ments and provide you with instructions to follow. All supporting documentationvideo footage and incident reports are forwarded to the office and a letter and citation will be sent.  Owners are responsible for always keeping their dogs under control. Unleashed dogs that are not on their properties are dogs at large. For your dog  s own safety and the safety of others, please do not allow your dogs to roam.  The school year has started and, as a reminder, please follow the school bus drop off and pick - up protocols.  Failure to stop at the stop signs and speeding are the 2 biggest causes of fines in the community we have to date. It would be greatly appreciated if everyone would please slow down and stop when you see one of those signs. Bus Lot Procedure Reminder Afternoon Bus Lot Procedure  All vehicles must remain parked while the bus is in the lot.  A Security Officer or Bus Monitor will release the bus through the bus gate. Only buses can exit via the bus gate.  Cars are to remain parked until the Security Officer or Bus Monitor directs your aisle to leave. A1 - lane 1 then lane 2 or A2 - lane 1 then lane 2 September 2024 September 2024 Why Is There A Proposed Increase To Our Dues? In an HOA community members pay their dues, and the Board spends your money with the fiduciary responsibility we know we are bound to when joining the Board of Directors. We accept responsibility for acting solely in the best interest of the community that includes loyalty, care, good faith, confidentiality and more when serving the members of this community. When you as a member vote to approve our yearly budgets, we are granted, by the voting members, the ability to spend that money as we see would benefit the community in the best way possible. The community  s expenses are impacted the same way and even more than a homeowner  s when rates increase. In addition to paying for the everyday needs of the community we also need to plan for unforeseen repairs or obsolete equipment. That is what our Reserve money is set aside for every year. It acts like a cushion that protects the association from unplanned expenses and essential upgrades over time. You may not be happy with an increase in dues, but we think you would be even more unhappy if the association had no Reserve funds. We try to keep the increases to a minimum, but as we are sure you see in your daily life, prices are increasing continuously. One thing that helps keep the increase to a minimum is our volunteers. If we did not have our volunteers do the duties necessary that go along with each committee as well as at Dumpster Day, the Annual Picnic and community clean ups just to name a few, our dues would be much higher. Why A Non - Disclosure Agreement? Members of the board have always taken the community members  privacy and right to confidentiality very seriously. As members of the Board of Directors or certain committees, we ask that an NDA non - disclosure agreement is signed. That is part of the fiduciary duty, to not disclose any privileged or confidential information that is acquire while acting as a board member, and beyond. This is also for the members  protection. We do not feel that if a homeowner is facing financial hardship and cannot pay their dues that it should become public knowledge, or if they are dealing with a health condition and their property becomes unkempt that is should be posted for all to see. There is a level of respect and ethical standards that needs to be in place for our members. We ask that you do not listen to the rumors and misconceptions but come to the committee and board meetings so you can see for yourself what goes on in the community that you have chosen to call home. Please do not be a inactive member in our community that has so much to offer. Annual Board Meeting Reminder Our annual board meeting is scheduled for September 28th starting at 9:00 am. It will be held at St. Vincent  s Parish Hall located on Route 739. Please remember to mail out your ballotsproxies so that they are received by the accountant no later than the close of business on Friday, September 20, 2024. Do not bring your mail - in ballotsproxies to the office or the Annual Meeting, as they can not be accepted. September 2024 Committee Reorganization Happens in October October will begin our new fiscal year, and with that comes the reorganization of our committees. If you are interested in joining a committee, there will be sign up sheets at the annual meeting on the back tables. Conashaugh Lakes has several committees you can join: Rules and Regulations, Design and Review, Maintenance, Security, Communication, Recreation, Environmental, Strategic Planning  Resources, and Finance. There is no obligation to attend every meeting should you join a committee. If you can  t make the reorganization meeting you can attend the other committee meetings held throughout the year. We hope you will take the opportunity to attend some meetings.

We moved here to get away from the city and to enjoy nature and we have plenty of it. I am an avid outdoorsman who hunts, fishes and ties all of my own flies. I would love to have members of our community join in and enjoy these hobbies together as a community. I am looking to start this group for all members of every age. I am looking for at least 2 volun- teers to help me get this group started and I  m welcome to all ideas. Here is what I have so far to get this up and running. Meetings - For hunting and fishing I  m suggesting meeting 2 times a month. One meeting will be on hunting and the second on fishing. Of course two meetings a month will be during an open season for hunting. When there is no open season, we will have 1 meeting per month for fishing. We will discuss many topics for each activity. Examples are meet ups for a hunt, how will we plan the hunt, etc. For fishing there will be topics like types of lures or flies for that time of the season, lakes, streams and rivers we can try, days we can have fish- ing trips for the members, etc. I also want to plan monthly prize pools for the largest size of our game and fish. I would love to have a class for the kids on how to fish, boater safety and fishing techniques. Depending on Conashaugh  s budget for this club, I would also like to do giveaways for the kids and possibly the adults. I  m also thinking of doing dues so we can use that money to better these giveaways and help pay for food and drinks for our meetings. Fly Tying - As far as fly tying classes and teaching anyone who wants to learn how to cast a flyrod, I am thinking about doing a class once per month. We have a few great fly tyers in our community who I will reach out to help. I have 2 vises we can use and I  m sure the guys who also tie can bring their vise as well. I will be looking online for some cheap used vises if we have a lot of people taking the monthly classes. I will also reach out to our local fly shops and my online friends to see if they can help us gather materials and thread. I have plenty of deer fur for us to use. After our classes we can plan trips to the rivers and streams to test out our flies we tied. Nothing better than catching a fish off your own fly. Again, I am looking for all ideas to make this a great group. So if there are any questions or comments, you can reach out to me at dukejr95gmail.com or the recreation committee at recreationconashaughlakes.com. I can  t wait to get this started and I hope we have a great turnout. October 2024 October 2024 Committee Members Needed Do you have ideas you want to share with the community?

The reason for this is the mailbox area has constantly flowing traffic which makes it an unsafe area for the children to walk through. The main bus lot has a safety routine that all drivers who are there for the bus are familiar with. The vehicles are not directed out until the monitor sees all children are safe from the moving cars and then they proceed with caution. This routine will ensure the safety of all.

There are currently three officers assigned to the Community. Lead officer Teresa Binder, officer Devon Simmons and officer Robert Reim.  Tailgating at the front gate known as trespassing in the Rules and Regulations contin- ues to be an issue in our community both with outsiders and, most importantly, our mem- bers. Keep in mind that the fine for this is 150.00. It is expected that all members adhere to the no tailgating rule.  Speeding on the roads of our community also continues to be an issue. The majority of the infractions are between 30 - 40 mph in the 25 mph zones. Be mindful of the speed lim- its when driving in our community for your safety as well as the safety of others.  Dogs at large is an ongoing serious issue. The Pike County Dog Warden has been noti- fied of one case in particular and will pursue this. Because of this, no community citation was issued because we cannot double fine an owner for matters being fined by the Dog Warden.  There have been reports of a pick - up truck stopping in front of houses, pulling into the driveways and shining lights into the house, doing donuts and speeding off. Security is aware of the issue. If anyone experiences anything like this, please report it to the office immediately. Camera footage is also requested wherever possible.  Regarding the property at 131 Conashaugh Trail, the owner is currently incarcerated, and his purple Mustang has been reported as missing from his driveway as of Oct 15, 2024. The Pike County DA has been made aware of this. If anyone has any information regard- ing this incident, please call the office.  There is an increase in Conashaugh Community vandalism. At the basketball courts, the gate has been damaged and cut twice and the hoop was damaged. On Iroquois, 2 chil- dren at play signs were ripped out of ground and thrown down. Various places in the community such as Braxton Way and Overbrook Run past the tennis courts have skid marks from vehicles doing donuts. Security and the office is working on ways to possibly identify who is responsible. If anyone has any information regarding these issues, please call the office.

The reason for this is the mailbox area has constantly flowing traffic which makes it an unsafe area for the children to walk through. The main bus lot has a safety routine that all drivers who are there for the bus are familiar with. The vehicles are not directed out until the monitor sees all children are safe from the moving cars and then they proceed with caution. This routine will ensure the safety of all. We also ask that when you do park in the mailbox area for mail pickup or recycling, please park within the marked lines.

Key points about smoke and CO detectors: Early Warning: Both types of detectors alert residents to potential dangers before they become significant, giving crucial time to escape a fire or a CO leak. Carbon Monoxide is Invisible and Odorless: CO is a colorless, odorless gas that can be deadly when inhaled, making a CO detector es- sential to detect its presence. Placement Matters: Smoke detectors should be installed outside each sleeping area and on every floor of the home, while CO detectors should be placed near bedrooms and fuel - burning appliances. Regular Maintenance: Its important to test both smoke and CO detectors monthly and replace batteries as need- ed to ensure they are functioning properly. Even if your home is all electric, its still recommended that you install carbon monoxide de- tectors, as CO can seep inside the home from an attached garage or from outside. https:www.health.state.mn.uscommunities environmentairtoxinsindex.html https:www.pa.govcontentdamcopapwp - pagovenhealthdocumentstopicsdocuments environmental - health PEHDA_Carbon_Monoxide.pdf December 2024 December 2024 CLCA November Security Report Report ending November 30, 2024 Security has a new number 570 - 832 - 5660 All old numbers have been disconnected.

        "content": "S moke and carbon monoxide CO2 detectors are crucial for home safety because they provide early warning of potential life - threatening situations, like fires and carbon mon- oxide buildup, allowing occupants to evacuate quickly and safely, especially when dangers are silent and invisible like with CO gas; essentially, they can save lives by alerting you to dangers before they become serious. Key points about smoke and CO detectors: Early Warning: Both types of detectors alert residents to potential dangers before they become significant, giving crucial time to escape a fire or a CO leak. Carbon Monoxide is Invisible and Odorless: CO is a colorless, odorless gas that can be deadly when inhaled, making a CO detector es- sential to detect its presence. Placement Matters: Smoke detectors should be installed outside each sleeping area and on every floor of the home, while CO detectors should be placed near bedrooms and fuel - burning appliances. Regular Maintenance: Its important to test both smoke and CO detectors monthly and replace batteries as need- ed to ensure they are functioning properly.

We had an incident this past month wherein a homeowner thought she was letting her son and girlfriend in. She did not ask who it was, but just buzzed them in. It turns out it was not her relative, but someone else. It is essential that you know who you are letting in to our community.  Tele pad use - When entering the code for the tele pad, please follow these instructions: ONLY ENTER THE 4 NUMBERS NOT 4 NUMBERS CALL NOT 4 NUMBERS  Example: If your code is 1234, only enter 1234 Entering the code too many times incorrectly causes the tele pad to jam. If you are at the gate and have entered the code correctly and it  s still not working, it could be that the vehicle in front of you entered it wrong and it is now jammed. You must clear it by pressing  and then enter the code again. REMEMBER : ALL VISITORS ARE LET IN BY MEMBERS. SECURITY WILL NOT ALLOW ENTRY WITHOUT SPEAKING WITH THE HOMEOWNER AND GETTING PERMISSION AND PROPER VERIFICATION. IF YOU LIVE HERE AND FORGOT YOUR KEYCARD, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PROPER IDENTIFICATION WITH YOU AS SECU- RITY WILL NOT LET YOU IN WITHOUT IT. When at the member gate and allowing a visitor to follow you in using your gate card, swipe your card to allow yourself in, t hen put your card on top of the box and allow your visitor to swipe themselves in. Get your card when they get inside the gates. Do n ot have your visitor tailgate you in. Tailgating becomes trespassing and citations will follow. All members must swipe in, including motorcy- cles.  Speeding and careless driving  Watch out for your neighbor. We almost had a head - on collision this past month because someone was speeding, not paying attention to where they were going, came around a turn on the wrong side of the road, an almost hit an oncoming vehicle. We cant stress enough how important it is to drive carefully within the community  s speed limit.  Regular garbage in the recycling bins  seems to be an ongoing issue. This must stop as the recycling company could possibly fine us.  School Bus Bullying  we had a complaint recently of bullying on the school bus by a new resident. Please make all parents aware of this. Bullying is unacceptable behavior, and their child may be a victim of it and not say anything. It  s an important discussion to have at home.  Vehicles stopping on Conashaugh Trail to pick up children  this is not acceptable but has been happening daily. The traffic gets backed up and could potentially cause an accident with children running in the street to a car. Pick up your children from the buses in the designated pick - up spot in the front parking lot.  Vandalism  a members  home got egged not long ago. He was quite upset, as I  m sure we all would be. Talk with your young adults at home regarding vandalism. Just a gentle reminder that park- ing in the mailbox area to pick chil- dren up from the school bus is not permitted. It is unsafe and puts your child at risk of being hit by a car. Please use the bus area for drop off and pick up, the two extra minutes you spend may save a life. CAR REGISTRATIONS As we start 2025 be sure that all car registrations are updated with the CLCA Office. Stop in and see Liz, I know she would love to see you and give her copies of all updated car registrations. Every car with a gate card should have an updated registration on file. Or email them to Liz at adminassistantconashaughlakes.com FERUARY 2025 Do you have an idea for an article in the Conashaugh Courier? Forward it to me at CLCABoardDirectorGmail.com and the Communications Committee will print it!!! You could be a monthly contributor!!! FEBRUARY 2025 FEBRUARY 2025 Strawberry and Honey Dog Biscuits Ingredients 1 cup rolled oats  cup whole wheat flour or almond flour for a grain - free option 1 cup fresh strawberries, finely chopped or mashed 1 tablespoon honey 1 egg 2 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce optional Instructions Preheat your oven to 350F 175C and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, mash the strawberries using a fork or masher. Add the honey, egg, and applesauce to the mashed strawberries and mix well. Gradually add the rolled oats and flour, stirring until a dough forms. Adjust consistency with additional flour or water if needed. Lightly flour a surface and roll out the dough to  inch thickness. Use cookie cutters or shape the biscuits by hand. Place the biscuits on the baking sheet and bake for 15 - 20 minutes until golden brown and firm. Let the biscuits cool completely before serving. Frozen Strawberry Yogurt Dog Treats Ingredients Strawberries, how many depends on how many treats you want to make. Plain Greek Yogurt Other options to keep the red theme are beet juice or cranberries. Instructions Puree the strawberries. For a layered look, pour and freeze one ingredient at a time, starting with yogurt, and then strawberries. Freeze for 4 - 6 hours, or until completely frozen. Time will vary depending on the size of your ice cube mold. Tips Frozen strawberries work just as well as fresh. How- ever, allowing them to defrost for a bit makes them easier to blend. Adding a little water when blending the strawberries helps create a smoother texture that is easier to pour into your mold. Do not fill the mold to the top, leave room for ex- pansion when freezing. Store treats in the freezer for up to 6 months if they last that long.

Regular Check - Ups: - Schedule regular visits with your healthcare provider to monitor your heart health and discuss any concerns. Rou- tine screenings can help catch potential issues early. Community Engagement and Awareness 1. Wear Red: - Participate in National Wear Red Day usually the first Friday in February to raise awareness about heart disease in women. 2. Educate Others: - Share information about heart health with family and friends. 3. Support Research: - Consider donating to organizations that fund heart disease research and support awareness campaigns, such as the American Heart Association. 4. Volunteer: - Look for local heart health initiatives or events such as walkathons, health fairs, or educational seminars where you can contribute your time. By focusing on heart health during February and inte- grating these practices into your daily life, you can make a positive impact on your cardiovascular well - being. Re- member, small changes can lead to significant improve- ments over time. Take charge of your heart health today!

Discovering some title problems, the entire group except for Lord decided to purchase else- where. In 1810, Lord procured a valid title, and the property became part of the Blooming Grove Township. The Lord  s of Liverpool made their first home in the cabin of Sam Helm, a noted woodsman who  squatted  on the land. Helm acknowledged Lord  s claim to the property and offered it to him, and in the same gentlemanly spirit, Lord is said to have paid Helm for his improve- ments. The Lord  s began to make their living in the abundant timber. In response to traffic in the ar- ea, Simeon Lord built a hotel in 1850. The Lord House is today a Pike County Historic Site as well as a State Historical site. In the early part of the 20 th century, Sim Lord Jr., son of Sime- on Lord and grandson of Levi Ford, managed the hotel and sold gasoline. The Lords Valley Post Office also operated out of the Lord House from 1853 until 1955 when the Hawley Post Office. According to the county veterans grave registration card filed in 1935 by the PA Department of Military Affairs, Levi Lord was an army veteran, having served in the Revolutionary War and  local Indian war.  assumed responsibilities. The Lord House is the old red brick house located on Rt. 739 across from 84 Lumber The Stage Coach  The Hiawatha  stopped at the Lords House while it was a Post Office.

        "content": "MONTHLY SECURITY REPORT  Know your visitors  When being buzzed from the front gate for entry, it is a good idea to ask who it is that  s coming in to the community. We had an incident this past month wherein a homeowner thought she was letting her son and girlfriend in. She did not ask who it was, but just buzzed them in. It turns out it was not her relative, but someone else. It is essential that you know who you are letting in to our community.  Tele pad use - When entering the code for the tele pad, please follow these instructions: ONLY ENTER THE 4 NUMBERS NOT 4 NUMBERS CALL NOT 4 NUMBERS  Example: If your code is 1234, only enter 1234 Entering the code too many times incorrectly causes the tele pad to jam. If you are at the gate and have entered the code correctly and it  s still not working, it could be that the vehicle in front of you entered it wrong and it is now jammed. You must clear it by pressing  and then enter the code again. REMEMBER : ALL VISITORS ARE LET IN BY MEMBERS. SECURITY WILL NOT ALLOW ENTRY WITHOUT SPEAKING WITH THE HOMEOWNER AND GETTING PERMISSION AND PROPER VERIFICATION. IF YOU LIVE HERE AND FORGOT YOUR KEYCARD, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PROPER IDENTIFICATION WITH YOU AS SECU- RITY WILL NOT LET YOU IN WITHOUT IT. When at the member gate and allowing a visitor to follow you in using your gate card, swipe your card to allow yourself in, t hen put your card on top of the box and allow your visitor to swipe themselves in. Get your card when they get inside the gates. Do n ot have your visitor tailgate you in. Tailgating becomes trespassing and citations will follow. All members must swipe in, including motorcy- cles.  Speeding and careless driving  Watch out for your neighbor. We almost had a head - on collision this past month because someone was speeding, not paying attention to where they were going, came around a turn on the wrong side of the road, an almost hit an oncoming vehicle. We cant stress enough how important it is to drive carefully within the community  s speed limit.  Regular garbage in the recycling bins  seems to be an ongoing issue. This must stop as the recycling company could possibly fine us.  School Bus Bullying  we had a complaint recently of bullying on the school bus by a new resident. Please make all parents aware of this. Bullying is unacceptable behavior, and their child may be a victim of it and not say anything. It  s an important discussion to have at home.  Vehicles stopping on Conashaugh Trail to pick up children  this is not acceptable but has been happening daily. The traffic gets backed up and could potentially cause an accident with children running in the street to a car. Pick up your children from the buses in the designated pick - up spot in the front parking lot.  Vandalism  a members  home got egged not long ago. He was quite upset, as I  m sure we all would be. Talk with your young adults at home regarding vandalism.",

In a mixing bowl, mash the strawberries using a fork or masher. Add the honey, egg, and applesauce to the mashed strawberries and mix well. Gradually add the rolled oats and flour, stirring until a dough forms. Adjust consistency with additional flour or water if needed. Lightly flour a surface and roll out the dough to  inch thickness. Use cookie cutters or shape the biscuits by hand. Place the biscuits on the baking sheet and bake for 15 - 20 minutes until golden brown and firm. Let the biscuits cool completely before serving. Frozen Strawberry Yogurt Dog Treats Ingredients Strawberries, how many depends on how many treats you want to make. Plain Greek Yogurt Other options to keep the red theme are beet juice or cranberries. Instructions Puree the strawberries. For a layered look, pour and freeze one ingredient at a time, starting with yogurt, and then strawberries. Freeze for 4 - 6 hours, or until completely frozen. Time will vary depending on the size of your ice cube mold. Tips Frozen strawberries work just as well as fresh. How- ever, allowing them to defrost for a bit makes them easier to blend. Adding a little water when blending the strawberries helps create a smoother texture that is easier to pour into your mold. Do not fill the mold to the top, leave room for ex- pansion when freezing. Store treats in the freezer for up to 6 months if they last that long. We love our pets",

        "content": "February is American Heart Month, a time dedicated to raising awareness about heart disease and promoting cardio- vascular health. Here are some tips and information to help you prioritize your heart health in February and beyond: Understanding Heart Health 1. Know Your Numbers: - Blood Pressure: Aim for a reading below 12080 mm Hg. Always follow your physician  s recommendations. - Cholesterol Levels: Keep total cholesterol below 200 mgdL, with LDL bad cholesterol lower than 100 mgdL, and HDL good cholesterol above 50 mgdL for women and 40 mgdL for men. - Blood Sugar: Keep your fasting blood sugar levels below 100 mgdL to reduce diabetes risk and follow the advice of your physician. 2. Recognize the Symptoms: - Be aware of common heart attack symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and discomfort in the arms, back, neck, or jaw. Symptoms differ in men and women. Tips for a Heart - Healthy Lifestyle 1. Eat a Heart - Healthy Diet: - Fruits and Vegetables: Aim for at least 5 servings a day. - Whole Grains: Choose whole - grain bread, pasta, and cereals. - Healthy Fats: Incorporate sources of omega - 3 fatty acids, such as salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds, while limiting satu- rated and trans fats. - Limit Sodium: Reduce salt intake to help lower blood pressure. 2. Stay Active: - Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week. Activities can include brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or dancing. 3. Maintain a Healthy Weight: - Keep a healthy body weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise. Even a modest weight loss can improve heart health. 4. Quit Smoking: - If you smoke, seek help to quit. Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. 5. Limit Alcohol: - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. This generally means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. 6. Manage Stress: - Practice stress - reducing techniques such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. Getting enough sleep is also crucial for stress management. 7. Regular Check - Ups: - Schedule regular visits with your healthcare provider to monitor your heart health and discuss any concerns. Rou- tine screenings can help catch potential issues early. Community Engagement and Awareness 1. Wear Red: - Participate in National Wear Red Day usually the first Friday in February to raise awareness about heart disease in women. 2. Educate Others: - Share information about heart health with family and friends. 3. Support Research: - Consider donating to organizations that fund heart disease research and support awareness campaigns, such as the American Heart Association. 4. Volunteer: - Look for local heart health initiatives or events such as walkathons, health fairs, or educational seminars where you can contribute your time. By focusing on heart health during February and inte- grating these practices into your daily life, you can make a positive impact on your cardiovascular well - being. Re- member, small changes can lead to significant improve- ments over time. Take charge of your heart health today! FEBRUARY 2025",

Grease a 9 - by - 5 - inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and sea salt. Set it aside. In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork. Add the melted butter and oil and stir until combined. Stir in the brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Stir until smooth. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, dont overmix. Stir in  cup of the chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining  cup of chocolate chips over the top of the bread. Bake for 50 - 65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out mostly clean, you might have some melted chocolate chips on the toothpick and that is fine. You just dont want a lot of gooey batter. Check at 50 minutes, just to be safe. Oven times vary. Remove the pan from the oven and set on a wire cooling rack. Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the bread and carefully remove it from the pan. Let the bread cool on the wire cooling rack until slightly warm.

        "content": "The History of Lords Valley In 1809, Levi Lord, along with his son, Simeon, and twelve associates from England, came to this region in hopes of purchasing a land tract from Dr. Phillip Myddleton. Discovering some title problems, the entire group except for Lord decided to purchase else- where. In 1810, Lord procured a valid title, and the property became part of the Blooming Grove Township. The Lord  s of Liverpool made their first home in the cabin of Sam Helm, a noted woodsman who  squatted  on the land. Helm acknowledged Lord  s claim to the property and offered it to him, and in the same gentlemanly spirit, Lord is said to have paid Helm for his improve- ments. The Lord  s began to make their living in the abundant timber. In response to traffic in the ar- ea, Simeon Lord built a hotel in 1850. The Lord House is today a Pike County Historic Site as well as a State Historical site. In the early part of the 20 th century, Sim Lord Jr., son of Sime- on Lord and grandson of Levi Ford, managed the hotel and sold gasoline. The Lords Valley Post Office also operated out of the Lord House from 1853 until 1955 when the Hawley Post Office. According to the county veterans grave registration card filed in 1935 by the PA Department of Military Affairs, Levi Lord was an army veteran, having served in the Revolutionary War and  local Indian war.  assumed responsibilities.

Secure Doors and Windows  Use solid core or metal doors for all entry points.  Install deadbolt locks on exterior doors.  Reinforce sliding glass doors with a security bar or pin.  Ensure all windows have secure locks and consider window bars or security film. 2. Install a Security System  Invest in a home security system with alarms, cam- eras, and motion detectors.  Display security system signage to deter potential intruders. 3. Use Outdoor Lighting  Install motion - activated lights around entry points and dark areas of your property.  Keep outdoor lights on during the night to increase visibility. 4. Create the Illusion of Occupancy  Use timers to turn on lights, radios, or TVs when you  re not home.  Have a trusted neighbor collect your mail and pack- ages while you  re away. 5. Maintain Your Yard  Keep bushes and trees trimmed to eliminate hid- ing spots for intruders.  Use gravel or pebbles as ground cover near win- dows and doors to make noise when walked on. 6. Secure Your Garage  Keep garage doors closed and locked.  Install a security camera or motion sensor light in the garage. 7. Use Smart Technology  Consider smart locks and doorbell cameras to moni- tor entry points.  Use smart home systems that allow you to control lights and alarms remotely. 8. Be Cautious with Social Media  Avoid posting about your travel plans or being away from home on social media.  Wait until you  re back home to share vacation pho- tos. 9. Install a Peephole or Video Doorbell  Use a peephole or video doorbell to see who is at your door before opening it. 10. Keep Valuables Out of Sight  Store valuables, including electronics, jewelry, and important documents, in a safe or in hidden loca- tions.  Avoid leaving expensive items in plain view, espe- cially near windows. 11. Know Your Neighbors  Look out for each other  s homes and report any suspicious activity 12. Reinforce Windows  Consider installing window locks or security screens.  Use shatter - resistant glass or window film to make it harder to break in. By implementing these safety tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of a break - in and help protect your home and belongings.

My name is Jill ONeill. I have been a member of Conashaugh Lakes since July 2003, during which time I raised five children. Conashaugh Lakes has been and continues to be a wonderful community in which to raise a family. My children grew up riding their bikes, playing basketball, and spending summers at the pool. It is with great pleasure that I accept the position of Administrator. I look forward to collaborating with the Board of Directors, office staff, and community members. I began my career in community management in 2003 as the Administrative Assistant to the Property Manager at Pine Ridge Community Association in Bushkill, Pennsylvania. After six years with Pine Ridge, I was offered the Office ManagerBookkeeper position at Wild Acres Lakes Property Owners Association in Dingmans Ferry. While working at Wild Acres, I earned my CMCA Certified Manager of Community Associations and AMS Association Management Specialist Certifications. Within four years, I was promoted to Director of Operations, where I served the community for an additional five years. Throughout my years in community management, I have attended numerous committee meetings for Budget and Finance, Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, Recreation, and Security. Additionally, I have collaborated with Maintenance Departments and contractors on road paving projects, high- risk dam projects, pool repairs, and more. 5 Dear Members, Please join us in welcoming our new administrator! CONASHAUGH BUSINESS Administrator Welcome I take my role as Administrator very seriously. My goals are to maintain the financial stability of Conashaugh Lakes, complete projects on time, and continue providing a space where families can enjoy raising their children. Jill ONeill With the last day of school just around the corner lets all slow down and be extra careful for walking and playing children. Do you have an idea for an article in the Conashaugh Courier? Forward it to me at CLCABoardDirectorgmail.com and the Communications Committee will print it!!! You could be a monthly contributor!!! URGENT CAR REGISTRATIONS If your gate card has been deactivated please email or go see Liz in the office and update all your car registrations with a gate card attached to it.

Get in touch with me at communicationconashaughlakes.com and lets get some teams together and have some fun this summer! As always the courts will open and close during regular park hours. SUMMER SPORTS  ACTIVITIES Schools Out! Summer Activities 9 Boxes will be hung, with the picture below of Pop Tabs by the Mailboxes, Office, Recreation Building and Compactors. Drop off all your Pop Tabs and I will bring them to the Ronald McDonald House packaged with love from The Members of Conashaugh Lakes This baseball season at PNC Field, home of the ScrantonWilkes-Barre RailRiders, the Ronald McDonald House of Scranton is going BIG! Theyre on a mission to collect more Pop Tabs than ever before and set a world recordall while helping families stay close to their childrens medical care. Why Pop Tabs? They are pure aluminum, easy to collect, and turn into funding for their House. Every tab helps provide housing, meals, and support to families in need. The more they collect, the closer they get to making history!  Lets give The Ronald McDonald House   a Big Conashaugh Helping Hand  10 Yes, were Yes, were OPEN! OPEN! Were excited to announce that the Conashaugh Lakes community pool is set to open on schedule this Memorial Day weekend! While earlier phone estimates had raised concerns about potentially costly repairs that might have delayed the season, recent in- person evaluations brought great news: those major fixes arent necessary after all. Thanks to a closer look by professionals on-site, weve identified simpler, more efficient solutions that will get the pool up and running right on timeand just in time for the holiday. Community Pool Opening for the Season SURPRISES AT THE POOL THIS SUMMER! Pike Pizza will be parking their food truck at our poolside. They will be offering delightful lunches and poolside snacks at very reasonable prices. CONASHAUGH BUSINESS These new developments not only mean summer fun can start without delay, but also ensure the pool will remain easy to maintain throughout the season. This gives the community more breathing room to thoughtfully plan for the pools long-term future without sacrificing this years enjoyment. We appreciate everyones patience and support, and we cant wait to see you poolside for another great summer at Conashaugh Lakes! With summer on the horizon, for many families its swimsuit shopping season. This year, make a choice thats not only stylish, but also helps swimmers be safer by choosing bold, visible colors that dont camouflage easily in a pool. 11 Swimsuit Visibility Tests Prove It: Above are 14 different swimsuit colors in a pool, showing how they appear in three feet of water, with a still and agitated surface. While many dark colors were visible against the blue-bottomed pool, they would be easier to dismiss as shadow or debris, especially when their profile is broken up by surface agitation, and their apparent size possibly altered by refraction. The most visible? Neon orange, neon green, bright yellow and hot pink. Think 1980s colors. Pool Safety - Pick Bright Colors for Safety Neighbors brought their treasures to the front gate 40 bass, 9 lbs of bait fish, and a dozen perch.

To remove the cookie cutters, gently pull the metal away from the edges on all side then gently push the birdseed ornaments out of the cookie cutters. Gently pull the straws out. Thread a piece of twine through the hole and tie the ends in a knot. Hang the birdseed ornaments from tree branches, leaving room nearby for the birds to perch on while eating.

Have you witnessed a member of the Maintenance Crew going out of their way to make our community a better place? 24 SECURITY REPORT 25 Bins located in the mailbox area are for single stream recycling of household items only - it is not a collection box for miscellaneous metal items  strollers, bbqs, treadmills, etc  As a reminder, member vs member disputes harassment matters are not handled by the office. Harassment is a crime and needs to be reported to the Pennsylvania State Police. Matters involving domesticchild or animal abuse need to be r eported directly to agencies outside the community designated to handle such matters. The office cannot report these incidents for members. If you are a witness to any kind of these abuses, you must contact the agency directly. When our security personnel are doing property checks , keep in mind they are doing them at the behest of the property owners. Telling them to get off the properties they are checking after they told you what they are doing is not the correct thing to do. Tailgating continues to be an issue.

Maintain Your Yard Keep bushes and trees trimmed to eliminate hiding spots for intruders. Use gravel or pebbles as ground cover near win dows and doors to make noise when walked on. 6. Secure Your Garage Keep garage doors closed and locked. Install a security camera or motion sensor light in the garage. 2. Install a Security System Invest in a home security system with alarms, cameras, and motion detectors. Display security system signage to deter potential intruders. 4. Create the Illusion of Occupancy Use timers to turn on lights, radios, or TVs when youre not home. Have a trusted neighbor collect your mail and pack ages while youre away. 1. Secure Doors and Windows Use solid core or metal doors for all entry points. Install deadbolt locks on exterior doors. Reinforce sliding glass doors with a security bar or pin. Ensure all windows have secure locks and consider window bars or security film. 3. Use Outdoor Lighting Install motion-activated lights around entry points and dark areas of your property. Keep outdoor lights on during the night to increase visibility. Here is a list of suggestions of what we can do to keep our family, home and property safe. HOME SECURITY 9. Install a Peephole or Video Doorbell Use a peephole or video doorbell to see who is at your door before opening it. 11. Know Your Neighbors Look out for each others homes and report any suspicious activity 10. Keep Valuables Out of Sight Store valuables, including electronics, jewelry, and important documents, in a safe or in hidden locations. Avoid leaving expensive items in plain view, especially near windows. 8. Be Cautious with Social Media Avoid posting about your travel plans or being away from home on social media. Wait until youre back home to share vacation photos. 27 12. Reinforce Windows Consider installing window locks or security screens. Use shatter-resistant glass or window film to make it harder to break in. By implementing these safety tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of a break-in and help protect your home and belongings. HOME SECURITY IN CASE OF EMERGENCY YOUR FIRST CALL SHOULD ALWAYS BE TO 911 Security Phone  Pennsylvania State Police    570-832-5660 non-emergency 570-226-5718 7.

Conashaugh Lakes has been and continues to be a wonderful community in which to raise a family. My children grew up riding their bikes, playing basketball, and spending summers at the pool. It is with great pleasure that I accept the position of Administrator. I look forward to collaborating with the Board of Directors, office staff, and community members. I began my career in community management in 2003 as the Administrative Assistant to the Property Manager at Pine Ridge Community Association in Bushkill, Pennsylvania. After six years with Pine Ridge, I was offered the Office ManagerBookkeeper position at Wild Acres Lakes Property Owners Association in Dingmans Ferry. While working at Wild Acres, I earned my CMCA Certified Manager of Community Associations and AMS Association Management Specialist Certifications. Within four years, I was promoted to Director of Operations, where I served the community for an additional five years. Throughout my years in community management, I have attended numerous committee meetings for Budget and Finance, Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, Recreation, and Security. Additionally, I have collaborated with Maintenance Departments and contractors on road paving projects, high- risk dam projects, pool repairs, and more. 5 Dear Members, Please join us in welcoming our new administrator! CONASHAUGH BUSINESS Administrator Welcome I take my role as Administrator very seriously. My goals are to maintain the financial stability of Conashaugh Lakes, complete projects on time, and continue providing a space where families can enjoy raising their children. Jill ONeill",

While earlier phone estimates had raised concerns about potentially costly repairs that might have delayed the season, recent in- person evaluations brought great news: those major fixes arent necessary after all. Thanks to a closer look by professionals on-site, weve identified simpler, more efficient solutions that will get the pool up and running right on timeand just in time for the holiday. Community Pool Opening for the Season SURPRISES AT THE POOL THIS SUMMER! Pike Pizza will be parking their food truck at our poolside. They will be offering delightful lunches and poolside snacks at very reasonable prices. CONASHAUGH BUSINESS These new developments not only mean summer fun can start without delay, but also ensure the pool will remain easy to maintain throughout the season. This gives the community more breathing room to thoughtfully plan for the pools long-term future without sacrificing this years enjoyment. We appreciate everyones patience and support, and we cant wait to see you poolside for another great summer at Conashaugh Lakes!",

While many dark colors were visible against the blue-bottomed pool, they would be easier to dismiss as shadow or debris, especially when their profile is broken up by surface agitation, and their apparent size possibly altered by refraction.

The fact is the environment is also at risk from pyrotechnics. A firecracker flung by a 15 - year - old boy during a burn ban started a 2017 fire in Oregon  s Columbia River Gorge that burned for three months and charred 50,000 acres. Pockets of fire were still smoldering nine months after the blaze began. The lesson here is clear enough. You need to observe extreme care in celebrating the 4th with fireworks. Know all the dangers before you light the first fuse. The safety tips from Homeland Security come from its Transportation Safety Laboratory TSL.  Always use fireworks outdoors and keep a bucket of water or a hose nearby in case of accidents.  Never place a part of your body directly over a firework or hold a firework in your hand when lighting.  Light only one firework at a time.  Designate a safe perimeter to keep people safely away from fireworks.  For ground - based devices such as fountains, the perimeter should be 35 feet out.  For aerial devices, it should be 150 feet. Fireworks that dont go off when you light them can still explode.  Let duds sit for five or 10 minutes before you pick them up to dowse them in water. Include pet safety as well as human safety in your plans. Pets find fireworks highly stressful. Bring your pets indoors, close curtains and blinds and turn on the radio to provide some distraction. Leave treats filled with food to comfort animals. Keep the weather in mind when using fireworks. Never use fireworks if your locale has a burn ban. Never set off fireworks where falling embers could ignite buildings or vegetation. Homeland Security suggests using alternatives to fireworks such as party poppers, bubbles, silly string, or glow sticks. Sparklers may appear to be a safe alternative to things that go boom, but they are not. The NSC says sparklers burn at 2,000 degrees  enough to melt metal. For children under five, sparklers account for half of all fireworks injuries. Keep them away from kids and use glow sticks, confetti poppers or colored streamers. Final word on fireworks comes from the National Safety Council, which offers this as the safest way to enjoy fireworks:  Grab a blanket and a patch of lawn. Kick back and let the experts handle the fireworks show.  7 JULY 2025 Recognizing Dry Drowning: What You Need to Know As summer approaches and water activities become more popular, it  s essential for parents and caregivers to be aware of a condition known as dry drowning. While it is rare, understanding what it is and how to recognize its symptoms can be crucial for keeping children safe around water. What is Dry Drowning? Dry drowning occurs when a person has difficulty breathing after being submerged in water, but it does not always involve the lungs filling with water. Instead, it can happen when a person inhales water, causing a spasm in the airway that prevents breathing. This can occur immediately after a near - drowning incident or, in some cases, several hours later. Signs and Symptoms to Watch For It  s essential to monitor for symptoms of dry drowning after a child has been in or around water. Here are some key signs to look out for: 1. Coughing: A persistent cough can indicate that water has entered the airway. 2. Difficulty Breathing: If the child is struggling to breathe, has wheezing, or shows signs of labored breathing, it  s crucial to act quickly. 3. Chest Pain: Complaints of pain or discomfort in the chest may signal a serious issue. 4. Extreme Fatigue or Drowsiness: Unusual tiredness or lethargy can be a symptom of dry drowning, especially if it occurs after swimming. 5. Irritability or Changes in Behavior: If a child is unusually cranky or difficult to wake, it could indicate a problem. What to Do If You Suspect Dry Drowning If you notice any of the symptoms listed above after a child has been in water, take the following steps: - Seek Immediate Medical Attention: If the symptoms are severe or worsening, call emergency services or take the child to the nearest hospital. - Monitor Breathing: Keep an eye on the child  s breathing patterns and be ready to perform CPR if necessary. - Stay Calm: Your calm demeanor can help reassure the child during a frightening situation. Prevention is Key While dry drowning is rare, it  s important to take precautions to prevent drowning incidents in the first place: - Always supervise children closely when they are in or near water. - Ensure everyone knows how to swim and is comfortable in the water. - Enroll children in swimming lessons to boost their confidence and skills. Conclusion Understanding dry drowning and recognizing its symptoms can help ensure the safety of children around water. By staying vigilant and taking preventive measures, you can enjoy a safe and fun summer filled with water activities! 8 JULY 2025 9 JULY 2025 May Committee Briefings Security : Discussion of the continuous illegal pickup of children from the bus in the mailbox area.

Extreme heat can be dangerous  take steps now to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your pets.

This year, make a choice that  s not only stylish, but also helps swimmers be safer by choosing bold, visible colors that don  t camouflage easily in a pool. Above are 14 different swimsuit colors in a pool, showing how they appear in three feet of water, with a still and agitated surface. While many dark colors were visible against the blue - bottomed pool, they would be easier to dismiss as shadow or debris, especially when their profile is broken up by surface agitation, and their apparent size possibly altered by refraction. The most visible?  Neon orange, neon green, bright yellow and hot pink.   Think 1980 s colors.  15 JULY 2025 This page was left blank intentionally Why?

LET  S MAKE GOOD THINGS HAPPEN TOGETHER 16 JULY 2025 The Benefits of Volunteering: Why You Should Get Involved in Your Community Volunteering is one of the most rewarding activities you can engage in, both for yourself and for your community. Whether you  re lending a helping hand at the annual picnic, participating in a community cleanup, or helping the kids do an art project, the benefits of volunteering are abundant.

Helping others can reduce stress, combat depression, and increase feelings of happiness and satisfaction. The sense of purpose that comes from giving back can lead to greater overall well - being. 5. Gain a New Perspective Volunteering exposes you to different experiences and viewpoints that you might not encounter in your daily life. This can lead to greater empathy and understanding, helping you appreciate the diversity within your community. It can also inspire you to take action in other areas of your life. 6. Enhance Your Community When you volunteer, you contribute to the betterment of your community. Your efforts can lead to cleaner parks, more accessible resources for those in need, and programs that support education, health, and well - being. Together, volunteers can create a stronger, more vibrant community for everyone. Create Lasting Memories The experiences you gain through volunteering can be some of the most memorable moments of your life.

You might get a free comedy show. These berry frozen yogurt cubes blend fun and antioxidants. Win - win. Ingredients: 12 cup blueberries 12 cup strawberries hulled and chopped 1 cup plain Greek yogurt Directions: Blend berries and yogurt until beautifully purple and creamy. Pour the mixture into ice molds  in whatever ridiculous shapes you want. Freeze for at least 4 hours. Confession: These are actually pretty tasty for humans, too but don  t tell your dog. Frozen Banana Cat Treats Ripe bananas Cat treats Catmilk  such as Whiskas Catmilk Peel and Slice the Bananas: Start by peeling the ripe ba- nanas and cutting them into small, bite - sized pieces. This makes it easier to blend later. Blend the Bananas: Place the banana slices into a blend- er or food processor and add the Catmilk. Blend until you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. You will make at a ratio of one banana to one Catmilk container. Place Cat Treats in Ice Cube Tray: You will put the cat treats in the bottom of the tray. Pour into Ice Cube Tray: Once you have your banana - Catmilk puree ready, pour it into the ice cube tray over the cat treats. Freeze: Place the filled mold in your freezer and let it freeze for a few hours or until the treats are solid. Serve: When the treats are fully frozen, remove them from the tray and offer one to your cat. Keep the remain- ing treats stored in an airtight container in the freezer. 19 JULY 2025 Ingredients You  ll Need  1 plastic lid such as from a yogurt or sour cream container  Clear school glue enough to cover the bottom of your lid  A few drops of food coloring various colors  1 toothpick for swirling the colors  1 hole punch to make a hole for hanging  1 piece of ribbon, string, or fishing line for hanging Step - by - Step Instructions 1. Begin by choosing a plastic lid that will act as the base for your suncatcher. Clean it thoroughly and dry it completely. 2. Next, pour clear school glue into the lid until it covers the entire bottom. Gently tilt the lid if needed to spread the glue evenly. 3. Afterward, carefully add several drops of food coloring into the glue. You can opt for one color or multiple to create a rainbow - like effect. 4. Then, take your toothpick and gently swirl the food coloring through the glue. Be careful not to overmix, so the colors remain distinct and don  t muddy. 5. Now, set the lid aside in a safe, level place to dry. Depending on the glue  s thickness and humidity levels, drying could take anywhere from 8 to 24 hours. 6. Once fully dry and firm, remove the suncatcher from the lid. It should peel away easily. If it sticks, gently flex the lid to loosen it. 7. Use a hole punch to make a hole near the top of your suncatcher. 8. Finally, thread your ribbon or string through the hole, tie a knot, and hang your suncatcher in a sunny window to admire the vibrant colors shining through!

Secure Doors and Windows  Use solid core or metal doors for all entry points.  Install deadbolt locks on exterior doors.  Reinforce sliding glass doors with a security bar or pin.  Ensure all windows have secure locks and consider window bars or security film. 2. Install a Security System  Invest in a home security system with alarms, cam- eras, and motion detectors.  Display security system signage to deter potential intruders. 3. Use Outdoor Lighting  Install motion - activated lights around entry points and dark areas of your property.  Keep outdoor lights on during the night to increase visibility. 4. Create the Illusion of Occupancy  Use timers to turn on lights, radios, or TVs when you  re not home.  Have a trusted neighbor collect your mail and pack- ages while you  re away. 5. Maintain Your Yard  Keep bushes and trees trimmed to eliminate hid- ing spots for intruders.  Use gravel or pebbles as ground cover near win- dows and doors to make noise when walked on. 6. Secure Your Garage  Keep garage doors closed and locked.  Install a security camera or motion sensor light in the garage. 7. Use Smart Technology  Consider smart locks and doorbell cameras to moni- tor entry points.  Use smart home systems that allow you to control lights and alarms remotely. 8. Be Cautious with Social Media  Avoid posting about your travel plans or being away from home on social media.  Wait until you  re back home to share vacation pho- tos. 9. Install a Peephole or Video Doorbell  Use a peephole or video doorbell to see who is at your door before opening it. 10. Keep Valuables Out of Sight  Store valuables, including electronics, jewelry, and important documents, in a safe or in hidden loca- tions.  Avoid leaving expensive items in plain view, espe- cially near windows. 11. Know Your Neighbors  Look out for each other  s homes and report any suspicious activity 12. Reinforce Windows  Consider installing window locks or security screens.  Use shatter - resistant glass or window film to make it harder to break in. By implementing these safety tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of a break - in and help protect your home and belongings.

        "content": "7 JULY 2025 Recognizing Dry Drowning: What You Need to Know As summer approaches and water activities become more popular, it  s essential for parents and caregivers to be aware of a condition known as dry drowning. While it is rare, understanding what it is and how to recognize its symptoms can be crucial for keeping children safe around water. What is Dry Drowning? Dry drowning occurs when a person has difficulty breathing after being submerged in water, but it does not always involve the lungs filling with water. Instead, it can happen when a person inhales water, causing a spasm in the airway that prevents breathing. This can occur immediately after a near - drowning incident or, in some cases, several hours later. Signs and Symptoms to Watch For It  s essential to monitor for symptoms of dry drowning after a child has been in or around water. Here are some key signs to look out for: 1. Coughing: A persistent cough can indicate that water has entered the airway. 2. Difficulty Breathing: If the child is struggling to breathe, has wheezing, or shows signs of labored breathing, it  s crucial to act quickly. 3. Chest Pain: Complaints of pain or discomfort in the chest may signal a serious issue. 4. Extreme Fatigue or Drowsiness: Unusual tiredness or lethargy can be a symptom of dry drowning, especially if it occurs after swimming. 5. Irritability or Changes in Behavior: If a child is unusually cranky or difficult to wake, it could indicate a problem. What to Do If You Suspect Dry Drowning If you notice any of the symptoms listed above after a child has been in water, take the following steps: - Seek Immediate Medical Attention: If the symptoms are severe or worsening, call emergency services or take the child to the nearest hospital. - Monitor Breathing: Keep an eye on the child  s breathing patterns and be ready to perform CPR if necessary. - Stay Calm: Your calm demeanor can help reassure the child during a frightening situation. Prevention is Key While dry drowning is rare, it  s important to take precautions to prevent drowning incidents in the first place: - Always supervise children closely when they are in or near water. - Ensure everyone knows how to swim and is comfortable in the water. - Enroll children in swimming lessons to boost their confidence and skills. Conclusion Understanding dry drowning and recognizing its symptoms can help ensure the safety of children around water. By staying vigilant and taking preventive measures, you can enjoy a safe and fun summer filled with water activities!",

This year, make a choice that  s not only stylish, but also helps swimmers be safer by choosing bold, visible colors that don  t camouflage easily in a pool. Above are 14 different swimsuit colors in a pool, showing how they appear in three feet of water, with a still and agitated surface. While many dark colors were visible against the blue - bottomed pool, they would be easier to dismiss as shadow or debris, especially when their profile is broken up by surface agitation, and their apparent size possibly altered by refraction.

        "content": "19 JULY 2025 Ingredients You  ll Need  1 plastic lid such as from a yogurt or sour cream container  Clear school glue enough to cover the bottom of your lid  A few drops of food coloring various colors  1 toothpick for swirling the colors  1 hole punch to make a hole for hanging  1 piece of ribbon, string, or fishing line for hanging Step - by - Step Instructions 1. Begin by choosing a plastic lid that will act as the base for your suncatcher. Clean it thoroughly and dry it completely. 2. Next, pour clear school glue into the lid until it covers the entire bottom. Gently tilt the lid if needed to spread the glue evenly. 3. Afterward, carefully add several drops of food coloring into the glue. You can opt for one color or multiple to create a rainbow - like effect. 4. Then, take your toothpick and gently swirl the food coloring through the glue. Be careful not to overmix, so the colors remain distinct and don  t muddy. 5. Now, set the lid aside in a safe, level place to dry. Depending on the glue  s thickness and humidity levels, drying could take anywhere from 8 to 24 hours. 6. Once fully dry and firm, remove the suncatcher from the lid. It should peel away easily. If it sticks, gently flex the lid to loosen it. 7. Use a hole punch to make a hole near the top of your suncatcher. 8. Finally, thread your ribbon or string through the hole, tie a knot, and hang your suncatcher in a sunny window to admire the vibrant colors shining through! Let  s have some fun making glue suncatchers",

        "content": "29 JULY 2025 HOME SECURITY Here is a list of suggestions of what we can do to keep our family, home and property safe. 1. Secure Doors and Windows  Use solid core or metal doors for all entry points.  Install deadbolt locks on exterior doors.  Reinforce sliding glass doors with a security bar or pin.  Ensure all windows have secure locks and consider window bars or security film. 2. Install a Security System  Invest in a home security system with alarms, cam- eras, and motion detectors.  Display security system signage to deter potential intruders. 3. Use Outdoor Lighting  Install motion - activated lights around entry points and dark areas of your property.  Keep outdoor lights on during the night to increase visibility. 4. Create the Illusion of Occupancy  Use timers to turn on lights, radios, or TVs when you  re not home.  Have a trusted neighbor collect your mail and pack- ages while you  re away. 5. Maintain Your Yard  Keep bushes and trees trimmed to eliminate hid- ing spots for intruders.  Use gravel or pebbles as ground cover near win- dows and doors to make noise when walked on. 6. Secure Your Garage  Keep garage doors closed and locked.  Install a security camera or motion sensor light in the garage. 7. Use Smart Technology  Consider smart locks and doorbell cameras to moni- tor entry points.  Use smart home systems that allow you to control lights and alarms remotely. 8. Be Cautious with Social Media  Avoid posting about your travel plans or being away from home on social media.  Wait until you  re back home to share vacation pho- tos. 9. Install a Peephole or Video Doorbell  Use a peephole or video doorbell to see who is at your door before opening it. 10. Keep Valuables Out of Sight  Store valuables, including electronics, jewelry, and important documents, in a safe or in hidden loca- tions.  Avoid leaving expensive items in plain view, espe- cially near windows. 11. Know Your Neighbors  Look out for each other  s homes and report any suspicious activity 12. Reinforce Windows  Consider installing window locks or security screens.  Use shatter - resistant glass or window film to make it harder to break in. By implementing these safety tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of a break - in and help protect your home and belongings.

Come on by and Sssssee Connie! 6 SUMMER 2025 7 SUMMER 2025 What You Need to Know about Sun Safety Spending time outside is a great way to be physically active and reduce stress. You can work and play outside without raising your skin cancer risk by protecting your skin from the sun. Most skin cancers are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet UV light. UV rays are an invisible kind of radiation that comes from the sun, tanning beds, and sunlamps. UV rays can damage skin cells. Protection from UV rays is important all year, not just during the summer. UV rays can reach you on cloudy and cool days, and they reflect off of surfaces like water, cement, sand, and snow. How to protect your skin from the sun Shade You can reduce your risk of sun damage and skin cancer by staying in the shade under an umbrella, tree, or other shelter. Your best bet to protect your skin is to use sunscreen or wear protective clothing when youre outside  even when youre in the shade. Clothing When possible, wear long - sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts, which can provide protection from UV rays. If wearing this type of clothing isnt practical, try to wear a T - shirt or a beach cover - up. Clothes made from tightly woven fabric offer the best protection. A wet T - shirt offers much less UV protection than a dry one, and darker colors may offer more protection than lighter colors. Some clothing is certified under interna- tional standards as offering UV protection. Hat For the most protection, wear a hat that has a brim all the way around that shades your face, your ears, and the back of your neck. A tightly woven fabric, such as canvas, works best to protect your skin from UV rays. Avoid straw hats with holes that let sunlight through. A darker hat may offer more UV protection. If you wear a baseball cap, you should also protect your ears and the back of your neck by wearing clothing that covers those areas, using sunscreen, or staying in the shade. Sunglasses Sunglasses protect your eyes from UV rays and reduce the risk of cataracts. They also protect the tender skin around your eyes from sun exposure. Sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays offer the best protection. Most sunglasses sold in the United States, regardless of cost, meet this standard. Wrap - around sunglasses work best because they block UV rays from sneaking in from the side. Sunscreen Put on broad spectrum sunscreen that filters out both UVA and UVB rays and has an SPF of 15 or higher be- fore you go outside. Dont forget to put a thick layer on all exposed skin. Get help for hard - to - reach places like your back. And remember, sunscreen works best when combined with other options. Sunscreen is not recommended for babies who are 6 months old or younger. The US Food and Drug Admin- istration recommends keeping infants out of the sun during midday and using protective clothing if they have to be in the sun. SPF. Sunscreens are assigned a sun protection factor SPF, which is a number that rates how well they filter out UV rays. Higher numbers indicate more protection. You should use a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF of 15 or higher. Reapplication. Sunscreen wears off. Put it on again if you stay out in the sun for more than 2 hours and after swimming, sweating, or toweling off. 8 SUMMER 2025 The Rules on Fireworks Safety You know the damage fireworks can do to humans: severe burns and mangled fingers. The fact is the environment is also at risk from pyrotechnics. A firecracker flung by a 15 - year - old boy during a burn ban started a 2017 fire in Oregon  s Columbia River Gorge that burned for three months and charred 50,000 acres. Pockets of fire were still smoldering nine months after the blaze began. The lesson here is clear enough. You need to observe extreme care in celebrating the 4th with fireworks. Know all the dangers before you light the first fuse. The safety tips from Homeland Security come from its Transportation Safety Laboratory TSL.  Always use fireworks outdoors and keep a bucket of water or a hose nearby in case of accidents.  Never place a part of your body directly over a firework or hold a firework in your hand when lighting.  Light only one firework at a time.  Designate a safe perimeter to keep people safely away from fireworks.  For ground - based devices such as fountains, the perimeter should be 35 feet out.  For aerial devices, it should be 150 feet. Fireworks that dont go off when you light them can still explode.  Let duds sit for five or 10 minutes before you pick them up to dowse them in water. Include pet safety as well as human safety in your plans. Pets find fireworks highly stressful. Bring your pets indoors, close curtains and blinds and turn on the radio to provide some distraction. Leave treats filled with food to comfort animals. Keep the weather in mind when using fireworks. Never use fireworks if your locale has a burn ban. Never set off fireworks where falling embers could ignite buildings or vegetation. Homeland Security suggests using alternatives to fireworks such as party poppers, bubbles, silly string, or glow sticks. Sparklers may appear to be a safe alternative to things that go boom, but they are not. The NSC says sparklers burn at 2,000 degrees  enough to melt metal. For children under five, sparklers account for half of all fireworks injuries. Keep them away from kids and use glow sticks, confetti poppers or colored streamers. Final word on fireworks comes from the National Safety Council, which offers this as the safest way to enjoy fireworks:  Grab a blanket and a patch of lawn. Kick back and let the experts handle the fireworks show.  9 SUMMER 2025 10 SUMMER 2025 Japanese Barberry Berberis thunbergii DC. Barberry family Berberidaceae Origin: Japan Background Japanese barberry was introduced to the United States as an ornamental in 1875. Seeds were sent from Russia to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1896, it was planted at the New York Botanic Garden. It was eventually promoted as a substitute for Berberis vulgaris, an exotic plant introduced and used by early settlers from Europe for hedgerows, dyes and jams, and later found to be a host for the black stem rust of wheat. Distribution and Habitat Japanese barberry occurs and is reported to be invasive throughout the northeastern U.S. from Maine to North Carolina and west to Wisconsin and Missouri. It grows well in full sun to deep shade and forms dense stands in closed canopy forests, open woodlands, wetlands, fields and other areas. Ecological Threat Where it is well established, barberry displaces many native herbaceous and woody plants. In large infestations, its leaf lit ter causes changes in the chemistry of the soil, making it more basic. Description and Biology  Plant: spiny deciduous shrub typically to 3, but sometimes to 6 ft. in height; branches are deeply grooved, brown and usually have simple spines as opposed to 3 - pronged spines in exotic invasive European barberry  B. vulgaris  and the native Allegheny barberry  B. canadensis.  Leaves: small  - 1 inches long and shaped like small spatulas or narrow ovals, with a color ranging from green to blu- ish - green to dark reddish purple.  Flowers, fruits and seeds: flowering occurs in spring; abundant pale yellow flowers occur along the entire length of the stem in clusters of two to four; fruits are bright red berries about 13 in. long that mature July to October and per- sist through the winter.  Spreads: seed produced in abundance and eaten by birds like turkey and grouse and other wildlife that spread it far and wide; local vegetative spread is through root creepers and tip rooting branches. Prevention and Control Do not plant Japanese or European barberry. No biological control is available for this plant. Wearing thick gloves to protec t f rom spines, young plants can be pulled up by hand. A Weed Wrench can be used to uproot older shrubs when soil is moist. Shrubs c an also be mowed or cut repeatedly. Treatment with systemic herbicides like glyphosate and triclopyr has been very effective 11 SUMMER 2025 Are You a Thermometer or a Thermostat? In the realm of personal growth and self - awareness, a metaphor often used is comparing people to thermometers and thermostats. But what does this mean and which one are you? The Thermometer: A thermometer is a passive instrument. It reflects the temperature of its surroundings but has no control over it. Similarly, people who are like thermometers tend to mirror the emotions, attitudes and behaviors of those around them. If their environment is positive, theyre uplifted. Conversely, if theyre surrounded by negativity, their mood and actions shift to reflect that negativity. Characteristics of a Thermometer Person: - Reactive: They respond to the energy around them. - Adaptive: They easily blend into their environment. - Influenced: Their mood and productivity are swayed by external factors. The Thermostat: A thermostat, on the other hand, is an active instrument. It not only measures the temperature but also adjusts it to a desired setting. People who resemble thermostats have the power to influence their surroundings. They set the tone and create an atmosphere based on their internal mindset and values, rather than being swayed by external circumstances. Characteristics of a Thermostat Person: - Proactive: They take charge of their environment. - Influential: They have the ability to inspire and uplift others. - Resilient: Their mood and productivity are determined by their internal state rather than external factors very important characteristic Which One Are You? Reflecting on this metaphor, ask yourself: do you tend to react to the environment around you, or do you take control and shape it? Neither is inherently right or wrong, but understanding where you stand can help you grow. Tips for Becoming More Like a Thermostat: 1. Set Clear Intentions: Decide the kind of energy and atmosphere you want to create, both for yourself and those around you. 2. Cultivate Self - Awareness: Regularly check in with your thoughts and feelings. Understand what triggers your reactions and why. 3. Practice Emotional Regulation: Develop strategies to manage your emotions, so they dont control you. 4. Lead by Example: Demonstrate the behavior, attitude and values you wish to see in others. 5. Surround Yourself with Positivity: While you should aim to influence your environment, its also wise to choose supportive and positive surroundings whenever possible. In conclusion, whether youre a thermometer or a thermostat, the key is awareness and intentionality. By understanding your tendencies, you can strive to be the person who not only measures the climate but also creates it. Which one do you resonate with more, the thermometer or the thermostat? 12 SUMMER 2025 July Committee Briefings Security : Rules  Regulations : Finance : See Attached Report Strategic Planning : The Strategic Planning Committee has several activities in play. 1 The 2025 - 2030 Strategic Plan draft is soon to be presented to the BOD for approval. It is a simplified version of the 2024 - 2029 plan that is presently published on the Conashaugh Lakes Web Site. After several meetings with the Maintenance and Environmental committees we are adding a new line - item added to the strategic plan published on our community  s Web Site. It involves a feasibility study to relocate the swimming pool and this recreation center to highermore geologically stable ground. The North area of our community is high ground and the community owns 50 or so lots in the North of Conashaugh. This move will require a geological study. This is a complex undertaking and you will be hearing more about this in future meetings. Additionally, Jill, our new administrator and I, have been in discussions regarding several new HOA Management Software Packages, with the goal of updating our current management software. We are considering all aspects that the Conashaugh office must process such as payroll, accounting, communications, work orders, violations tracking as well as the ability for members to go on - line to obtain their current dues balance and update personal information. Lastly, we have an ongoing project with the US Postal Service that reorganizes all of the mailboxes alphabetically by street name and then by street number. This should greatly reduce mail delivery errors. We are also considering enlarging the oversize partial bins. Maintenance : Not Available Recreation : At the Recreation meeting they discussed the wonderful turn out for tickets to the picnic, There was a discussion of three upcoming outdoor movie nights. The need for volunteers is always a big topic. Environmental : Communications : At our committee meeting last month we worked on the Summer Edition of the Courier. Finalized the 911 signs for the Common Areas. Worked on advertising for the Courier. Business cards are free to Residents. And we also have our first full page ad- vertiser! 13 SUMMER 2025 Jill O  Neill Administrator Report  July 12, 2025 Pest Control Soliciting In June, a representative from Evergreen Pest Solutions entered the community without authorization. He stated that he had existing clients within the community and that he wasn  t soliciting; he was only advising the neighbors of what he was spraying so they wouldn  t be concerned. The Evergreen representative was asked to leave and not return unless he was in a commercial vehicle, had a member call the Administration Office to grant him entry into the community, or the member provided him with their gate access code. I contacted the State Police; however, since there are no signs at the entrances to the community, they were unable to take any action. Annual Meeting The Annual Meeting will be held on Saturday, September 27, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. at the Blooming Grove Volunteer Fire Hall located at 484 Route 739, Hawley, PA. Invitations have been sent to our Attorney, Tom Farley, and Accountant, Bradly Murray, to attend this year  s Annual Meeting. The accountant has also been requested to receive and count mail - in ballots. As a reminder, In - person Ballots will not be accepted during the annual meeting. Collections Files for Judgement Two cases were to be brought before the Magistrate Court for hearings on June 26, 2025. Both parties requested extensions. Attorney Farley is filing a motion for a 60 - day extension. If payment plans are not arranged or the defendants fail to appear in court, Attorney Farley will wait the required 30 days for an appeal before submitting a judgment for the remaining balance. Dangerous Tree Removal Blue Ridge Tree Service removed six hazardous trees from around the Administration Building on Friday, June 20. The cost of removing the trees was 2,000.00. The wood was left behind so that community members could collect it and use it for heating purposes. Guard Shack Heater Estimates for a new heating unit in the Guard Shack have been received from several HVAC companies: Laux Heat  Air at 3,000.00, Bottini Fuel at 3,050.00, SOS at 4,405.35, and Dibo  s HVAC at 3,000.00. Vegetation Management and Lake Management I received three quotes from Tigris Aquatic Services LLC for vegetation management. One is for a single herbicide application to eliminate vegetation growing in the rip - rap of Conashaugh Lake Dam, costing 1,007.00. The others are for treating 6 acres of submerged weeds, including Elodea, Bladderwort, and Sago Pondweed, for 2,862.00 and Seneca Lake for 2,141.20. Excessive growth can decrease dissolved oxygen levels during summer, leading to fish kills. Lake Closed for Swimming The Department of Health contacted the Administration Office on June 18, advising that we had to close and prohibit swimming due to a high E. coli level caused by all the rain we  ve received. The level has since decreased; however, we must have a single day passing sample below 235 and then go back 30 days from the collection date, enter the data on a geometric spreadsheet provided by the DOH. The total E. coli level must be below 126 for the lake to reopen for swimming. Fishing and boating are still permitted. Pre - bid Meeting  Compactor Project A pre - bid meeting was held on Monday, June 30 th, at 9:00 a.m. on - site for the compactor project. Kiley  Associates met with me, Craig Cuneo, as well as three contractors. Questions were raised regarding the power source for the compactors; a site survey is to be conducted by Kiley  Associates to determine the number of trees that will need to be removed from the area. The contractors bids will include the cost to cut and haul away the trees. Plans for a small building to monitor the area were also discussed. Kiley  Associates would like specifications for the self - contained dumpsters that will be placed at the new site. I contacted Eagle Equipment to see if they could provide me with the specs; I am waiting for Adam to get back to me to determine if a proposal for the same was ever submitted. Kiley  Associates will be emailing me with the questions and responses. On - site Unarmed Security Quotes A meeting was held with John Schaffer, Branch Manager at St. Moritz, in July to discuss the renewal of the contract with CLCA that expires in October. A 3 increase will take effect at the time of renewal, increasing the current hourly rate of 27.29 to 28.11 per hour. We also discussed pricing for a three - year contract with a 2 increase for the second and third year. KRE Security LLC also submitted a proposal for a one - year contract at a rate of 33.00 per hour. Both proposals include a marked security vehicle, fuel, and the holiday rate is billed at time and a half. 14 SUMMER 2025 15 SUMMER 2025 Understanding Cyberbullying: A Simple Guide for Children and Adults Cyberbullying is a significant issue that affects both children and adults.

This causes bears and other predatory animals to frequent the recyclable area, caus- ing destruction and a mess. Do not put food trash in the recycling containers  Someone left six bags of garbage outside the locked compactor gates on the morning of July 20, 2025 at 9:35 am. This could possibly cause predatory animals to frequent that area also so do not leave trash bags outside the compactor area.  Cardboard boxes must be flattened put in the recycling containers. They should NOT be put in the compactor. This is stated in our Rules and Regulations, Section 14.3 arti- cle j, which states as follows: All. flattened. cardboard,.magazines,.and.newspapers.are.to.be.placed.in.the. designated.CLCA.recycle.container.at.the.designated.site.during.posted.times. only.  Bags of leaves, lawn chairs, lockers and safes are not to be placed in the recycling bins. If these items are found in the bins by the waste company, we will be fined. The list of NON - RECYCLABLE items is as follows: Styrofoam Window Glass and Mirrors Electronic waste TVs and computers Motor oil containers Yard Waste leaves, etc Any Chemical containers Shredded Paper Plastic Bags Ceramics or Dishes Food Waste Any Scrap metal Lawn Chairs Folding Tables Exercise Equipment Safes Large Rubbermaid containers  This past month, there was a complaint of possible road rage made by one of our members. The vehicle in question was not registered in our systems. Keep in mind that in Pennsylvania, road rage is considered a criminal offense and can escalate quickly. If anyone is involved in such an incident, it is advisable to call PSP and re- port it. Try to get the license plate if you can as well. 19 SUMMER 2025 Did you know That your Conashaugh Lake Community Association Board Members are always here to help?

The two venomous species native to the state are the Timber Rattlesnake and the Eastern Massasauga. The Eastern Copperhead is also venomous but not a rattlesnake. Timber Rattlesnakes are more common and found in 51 of Pennsylvanias 67 counties, according to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Rattlesnake Species in Pennsylvania: Timber Rattlesnake Crotalus horridus: This is the most commonly encountered rattlesnake in Pennsylvania. They are known for their stout bodies and variable color patterns, which can be brown or black bands on a yellow to black background, according to the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program. Eastern Massasauga Sistrurus catenatus catenatus: This species prefers wet meadows and prairie areas, which are found in specific western counties of Pennsylvania. Safety Measures If you encounter a rattlesnake, remain calm, avoid sudden movements, and maintain a safe distance at least 10 feet. Do not attempt to kill or handle the snake, and do not throw objects at it. Alert others to the snakes presence and keep children and pets away. If bitten, seek immediate medical attention. Safety Tips Stay Calm: Panicking can lead to sudden movements that may startle or provoke the snake. Maintain Distance: Rattlesnakes typically strike when they feel threatened, so keeping a safe distance at least 10 feet is crucial. Dont Provoke: Avoid throwing objects, attempting to move the snake, or otherwise disturbing it. Alert Others: Let other people in the area know about the snakes location and advise them to proceed with caution. Keep Pets and Children Away: Ensure children and pets are kept at a safe distance from the snake. Seek Medical Attention: If bitten, seek immediate medical attention. If you hear a rattle: Stop and locate the sound before reacting. If you can safely back away, do so. On Trails: Stay on designated trails, avoid tall grass, and be aware of your surroundings. Keep your dog on a leash. If it doesnt move: If the snake doesnt move off the trail, its often best to wait it out or turn back. 21 SUMMER 2025 Were still in the thick of nymph season in PA! Even though nymph ticks are infect- ed at lower rates than adults, we still consider them the riskiest. Their small size makes them hard to see, meaning they often stay attached for longer. The longer a tick is attached, the more likely they are to transmit illness. 22 SUMMER 2025 What could be the downside of criticizing my HOA  s Board of Directors? Criticizing your community and its Board of Directors on Facebook can have significant downsides, both for individuals and the broader community. Social media posts are often permanent and highly visible, making it easy for offhand or poorly worded criticisms to cause lasting reputational harm that could impact home prices. It could impact how contractors view doing business with the community. It could impact the relationship that the community has with its banker and insurance provider. For example, let  s imagine that someone in the community posted a negative comment about the management of a CLCA project and for some reason the project ended up in a legal dispute. That criticism may become evidence that the insurance company uses as justification to raise the premium for the community. Who suffers - the homeowners that pay as a part of their dues the Insurance premium. So, think before you post. Also, unlike face - to - face conversations, online comments lack the immediate feedback of body language and tone, which can lead to misunderstandings, misquotes, and sweeping generalizations that distort the truth and escalate tensions. This dynamic can result in ruined reputations, damaged relationships, and can lead to legal proceedings, if the posts become harassment or slanderous. It actually strikes me as a bit cowardly to use the anonymity and distance provided by social platforms to embolden oneself to be aggressive and unkind. Criticism of our community and its board of directors on Facebook can undermine trust in the community leadership, erode the community fabric, and sow disunity among residents. Social media debates can quickly devolve into factionalism, with personal attacks and misinformation fueling open conflict rather than constructive dialogue. This not only distracts board members from their responsibilities but also makes it harder to resolve issues effectively. Furthermore, viral posts can attract attention beyond the community, exposing sensitive matters to outsiders and increasing the risk of reduced reputation and influence for both individuals and our community as a whole. Ultimately, while transparency and accountability are important, airing grievances on Facebook often does more harm than good. We need our board of directors, our volunteers, and the members of our community especially those with leadership training to help put a stop to the offensive Facebook posts. We will all benefit ethically and financially. A more constructive alternative to Facebook would be to volunteer to join and bring your perspective to committees, routinely attend committee and board meetings, and civilly engage with members of the board. If you are already a volunteer, please consider what you post and its impact before you post it! John A. Thies Rules  Regulations Liaison 23 SUMMER 2025 The Benefits of Volunteering: Why You Should Get Involved in Your Community Volunteering is one of the most rewarding activities you can engage in, both for yourself and for your community.

Begin by choosing a plastic lid that will act as the base for your suncatcher. Clean it thoroughly and dry it completely. 2. Next, pour clear school glue into the lid until it covers the entire bottom. Gently tilt the lid if needed to spread the glue evenly. 3. Afterward, carefully add several drops of food coloring into the glue. You can opt for one color or multiple to create a rainbow - like effect. 4. Then, take your toothpick and gently swirl the food coloring through the glue. Be careful not to overmix, so the colors remain distinct and don  t muddy. 5. Now, set the lid aside in a safe, level place to dry. Depending on the glue  s thickness and humidity levels, drying could take anywhere from 8 to 24 hours. 6. Once fully dry and firm, remove the suncatcher from the lid. It should peel away easily. If it sticks, gently flex the lid to loosen it. 7. Use a hole punch to make a hole near the top of your suncatcher. 8. Finally, thread your ribbon or string through the hole, tie a knot, and hang your suncatcher in a sunny window to admire the vibrant colors shining through!

Secure Doors and Windows  Use solid core or metal doors for all entry points.  Install deadbolt locks on exterior doors.  Reinforce sliding glass doors with a security bar or pin.  Ensure all windows have secure locks and consider window bars or security film. 2. Install a Security System  Invest in a home security system with alarms, cam- eras, and motion detectors.  Display security system signage to deter potential intruders. 3. Use Outdoor Lighting  Install motion - activated lights around entry points and dark areas of your property.  Keep outdoor lights on during the night to increase visibility. 4. Create the Illusion of Occupancy  Use timers to turn on lights, radios, or TVs when you  re not home.  Have a trusted neighbor collect your mail and pack- ages while you  re away. 5. Maintain Your Yard  Keep bushes and trees trimmed to eliminate hid- ing spots for intruders.  Use gravel or pebbles as ground cover near win- dows and doors to make noise when walked on. 6. Secure Your Garage  Keep garage doors closed and locked.  Install a security camera or motion sensor light in the garage. 7. Use Smart Technology  Consider smart locks and doorbell cameras to moni- tor entry points.  Use smart home systems that allow you to control lights and alarms remotely. 8. Be Cautious with Social Media  Avoid posting about your travel plans or being away from home on social media.  Wait until you  re back home to share vacation pho- tos. 9. Install a Peephole or Video Doorbell  Use a peephole or video doorbell to see who is at your door before opening it. 10. Keep Valuables Out of Sight  Store valuables, including electronics, jewelry, and important documents, in a safe or in hidden loca- tions.  Avoid leaving expensive items in plain view, espe- cially near windows. 11. Know Your Neighbors  Look out for each other  s homes and report any suspicious activity 12. Reinforce Windows  Consider installing window locks or security screens.  Use shatter - resistant glass or window film to make it harder to break in. By implementing these safety tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of a break - in and help protect your home and belongings.

        "content": "7 SUMMER 2025 What You Need to Know about Sun Safety Spending time outside is a great way to be physically active and reduce stress. You can work and play outside without raising your skin cancer risk by protecting your skin from the sun. Most skin cancers are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet UV light. UV rays are an invisible kind of radiation that comes from the sun, tanning beds, and sunlamps. UV rays can damage skin cells. Protection from UV rays is important all year, not just during the summer. UV rays can reach you on cloudy and cool days, and they reflect off of surfaces like water, cement, sand, and snow. How to protect your skin from the sun Shade You can reduce your risk of sun damage and skin cancer by staying in the shade under an umbrella, tree, or other shelter. Your best bet to protect your skin is to use sunscreen or wear protective clothing when youre outside  even when youre in the shade. Clothing When possible, wear long - sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts, which can provide protection from UV rays. If wearing this type of clothing isnt practical, try to wear a T - shirt or a beach cover - up. Clothes made from tightly woven fabric offer the best protection. A wet T - shirt offers much less UV protection than a dry one, and darker colors may offer more protection than lighter colors. Some clothing is certified under interna- tional standards as offering UV protection. Hat For the most protection, wear a hat that has a brim all the way around that shades your face, your ears, and the back of your neck. A tightly woven fabric, such as canvas, works best to protect your skin from UV rays. Avoid straw hats with holes that let sunlight through. A darker hat may offer more UV protection. If you wear a baseball cap, you should also protect your ears and the back of your neck by wearing clothing that covers those areas, using sunscreen, or staying in the shade. Sunglasses Sunglasses protect your eyes from UV rays and reduce the risk of cataracts. They also protect the tender skin around your eyes from sun exposure. Sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays offer the best protection. Most sunglasses sold in the United States, regardless of cost, meet this standard. Wrap - around sunglasses work best because they block UV rays from sneaking in from the side. Sunscreen Put on broad spectrum sunscreen that filters out both UVA and UVB rays and has an SPF of 15 or higher be- fore you go outside. Dont forget to put a thick layer on all exposed skin. Get help for hard - to - reach places like your back. And remember, sunscreen works best when combined with other options. Sunscreen is not recommended for babies who are 6 months old or younger. The US Food and Drug Admin- istration recommends keeping infants out of the sun during midday and using protective clothing if they have to be in the sun. SPF. Sunscreens are assigned a sun protection factor SPF, which is a number that rates how well they filter out UV rays. Higher numbers indicate more protection. You should use a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF of 15 or higher. Reapplication. Sunscreen wears off. Put it on again if you stay out in the sun for more than 2 hours and after swimming, sweating, or toweling off.",

        "content": "8 SUMMER 2025 The Rules on Fireworks Safety You know the damage fireworks can do to humans: severe burns and mangled fingers. The fact is the environment is also at risk from pyrotechnics. A firecracker flung by a 15 - year - old boy during a burn ban started a 2017 fire in Oregon  s Columbia River Gorge that burned for three months and charred 50,000 acres. Pockets of fire were still smoldering nine months after the blaze began. The lesson here is clear enough. You need to observe extreme care in celebrating the 4th with fireworks. Know all the dangers before you light the first fuse. The safety tips from Homeland Security come from its Transportation Safety Laboratory TSL.  Always use fireworks outdoors and keep a bucket of water or a hose nearby in case of accidents.  Never place a part of your body directly over a firework or hold a firework in your hand when lighting.  Light only one firework at a time.  Designate a safe perimeter to keep people safely away from fireworks.  For ground - based devices such as fountains, the perimeter should be 35 feet out.  For aerial devices, it should be 150 feet. Fireworks that dont go off when you light them can still explode.  Let duds sit for five or 10 minutes before you pick them up to dowse them in water. Include pet safety as well as human safety in your plans. Pets find fireworks highly stressful. Bring your pets indoors, close curtains and blinds and turn on the radio to provide some distraction. Leave treats filled with food to comfort animals. Keep the weather in mind when using fireworks. Never use fireworks if your locale has a burn ban. Never set off fireworks where falling embers could ignite buildings or vegetation. Homeland Security suggests using alternatives to fireworks such as party poppers, bubbles, silly string, or glow sticks. Sparklers may appear to be a safe alternative to things that go boom, but they are not. The NSC says sparklers burn at 2,000 degrees  enough to melt metal. For children under five, sparklers account for half of all fireworks injuries. Keep them away from kids and use glow sticks, confetti poppers or colored streamers. Final word on fireworks comes from the National Safety Council, which offers this as the safest way to enjoy fireworks:  Grab a blanket and a patch of lawn. Kick back and let the experts handle the fireworks show.",

        "content": "10 SUMMER 2025 Japanese Barberry Berberis thunbergii DC. Barberry family Berberidaceae Origin: Japan Background Japanese barberry was introduced to the United States as an ornamental in 1875. Seeds were sent from Russia to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1896, it was planted at the New York Botanic Garden. It was eventually promoted as a substitute for Berberis vulgaris, an exotic plant introduced and used by early settlers from Europe for hedgerows, dyes and jams, and later found to be a host for the black stem rust of wheat. Distribution and Habitat Japanese barberry occurs and is reported to be invasive throughout the northeastern U.S. from Maine to North Carolina and west to Wisconsin and Missouri. It grows well in full sun to deep shade and forms dense stands in closed canopy forests, open woodlands, wetlands, fields and other areas. Ecological Threat Where it is well established, barberry displaces many native herbaceous and woody plants. In large infestations, its leaf lit ter causes changes in the chemistry of the soil, making it more basic. Description and Biology  Plant: spiny deciduous shrub typically to 3, but sometimes to 6 ft. in height; branches are deeply grooved, brown and usually have simple spines as opposed to 3 - pronged spines in exotic invasive European barberry  B. vulgaris  and the native Allegheny barberry  B. canadensis.  Leaves: small  - 1 inches long and shaped like small spatulas or narrow ovals, with a color ranging from green to blu- ish - green to dark reddish purple.  Flowers, fruits and seeds: flowering occurs in spring; abundant pale yellow flowers occur along the entire length of the stem in clusters of two to four; fruits are bright red berries about 13 in. long that mature July to October and per- sist through the winter.  Spreads: seed produced in abundance and eaten by birds like turkey and grouse and other wildlife that spread it far and wide; local vegetative spread is through root creepers and tip rooting branches. Prevention and Control Do not plant Japanese or European barberry. No biological control is available for this plant. Wearing thick gloves to protec t f rom spines, young plants can be pulled up by hand. A Weed Wrench can be used to uproot older shrubs when soil is moist. Shrubs c an also be mowed or cut repeatedly. Treatment with systemic herbicides like glyphosate and triclopyr has been very effective",

        "content": "11 SUMMER 2025 Are You a Thermometer or a Thermostat? In the realm of personal growth and self - awareness, a metaphor often used is comparing people to thermometers and thermostats. But what does this mean and which one are you? The Thermometer: A thermometer is a passive instrument. It reflects the temperature of its surroundings but has no control over it. Similarly, people who are like thermometers tend to mirror the emotions, attitudes and behaviors of those around them. If their environment is positive, theyre uplifted. Conversely, if theyre surrounded by negativity, their mood and actions shift to reflect that negativity. Characteristics of a Thermometer Person: - Reactive: They respond to the energy around them. - Adaptive: They easily blend into their environment. - Influenced: Their mood and productivity are swayed by external factors. The Thermostat: A thermostat, on the other hand, is an active instrument. It not only measures the temperature but also adjusts it to a desired setting. People who resemble thermostats have the power to influence their surroundings. They set the tone and create an atmosphere based on their internal mindset and values, rather than being swayed by external circumstances. Characteristics of a Thermostat Person: - Proactive: They take charge of their environment. - Influential: They have the ability to inspire and uplift others. - Resilient: Their mood and productivity are determined by their internal state rather than external factors very important characteristic Which One Are You? Reflecting on this metaphor, ask yourself: do you tend to react to the environment around you, or do you take control and shape it? Neither is inherently right or wrong, but understanding where you stand can help you grow. Tips for Becoming More Like a Thermostat: 1. Set Clear Intentions: Decide the kind of energy and atmosphere you want to create, both for yourself and those around you. 2. Cultivate Self - Awareness: Regularly check in with your thoughts and feelings. Understand what triggers your reactions and why. 3. Practice Emotional Regulation: Develop strategies to manage your emotions, so they dont control you. 4. Lead by Example: Demonstrate the behavior, attitude and values you wish to see in others. 5. Surround Yourself with Positivity: While you should aim to influence your environment, its also wise to choose supportive and positive surroundings whenever possible. In conclusion, whether youre a thermometer or a thermostat, the key is awareness and intentionality. By understanding your tendencies, you can strive to be the person who not only measures the climate but also creates it. Which one do you resonate with more, the thermometer or the thermostat?",

It is a simplified version of the 2024 - 2029 plan that is presently published on the Conashaugh Lakes Web Site. After several meetings with the Maintenance and Environmental committees we are adding a new line - item added to the strategic plan published on our community  s Web Site. It involves a feasibility study to relocate the swimming pool and this recreation center to highermore geologically stable ground. The North area of our community is high ground and the community owns 50 or so lots in the North of Conashaugh. This move will require a geological study. This is a complex undertaking and you will be hearing more about this in future meetings. Additionally, Jill, our new administrator and I, have been in discussions regarding several new HOA Management Software Packages, with the goal of updating our current management software. We are considering all aspects that the Conashaugh office must process such as payroll, accounting, communications, work orders, violations tracking as well as the ability for members to go on - line to obtain their current dues balance and update personal information. Lastly, we have an ongoing project with the US Postal Service that reorganizes all of the mailboxes alphabetically by street name and then by street number. This should greatly reduce mail delivery errors. We are also considering enlarging the oversize partial bins. Maintenance : Not Available Recreation : At the Recreation meeting they discussed the wonderful turn out for tickets to the picnic, There was a discussion of three upcoming outdoor movie nights. The need for volunteers is always a big topic. Environmental : Communications : At our committee meeting last month we worked on the Summer Edition of the Courier. Finalized the 911 signs for the Common Areas. Worked on advertising for the Courier. Business cards are free to Residents. And we also have our first full page ad- vertiser!",

        "content": "13 SUMMER 2025 Jill O  Neill Administrator Report  July 12, 2025 Pest Control Soliciting In June, a representative from Evergreen Pest Solutions entered the community without authorization. He stated that he had existing clients within the community and that he wasn  t soliciting; he was only advising the neighbors of what he was spraying so they wouldn  t be concerned. The Evergreen representative was asked to leave and not return unless he was in a commercial vehicle, had a member call the Administration Office to grant him entry into the community, or the member provided him with their gate access code. I contacted the State Police; however, since there are no signs at the entrances to the community, they were unable to take any action. Annual Meeting The Annual Meeting will be held on Saturday, September 27, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. at the Blooming Grove Volunteer Fire Hall located at 484 Route 739, Hawley, PA. Invitations have been sent to our Attorney, Tom Farley, and Accountant, Bradly Murray, to attend this year  s Annual Meeting. The accountant has also been requested to receive and count mail - in ballots. As a reminder, In - person Ballots will not be accepted during the annual meeting. Collections Files for Judgement Two cases were to be brought before the Magistrate Court for hearings on June 26, 2025. Both parties requested extensions. Attorney Farley is filing a motion for a 60 - day extension. If payment plans are not arranged or the defendants fail to appear in court, Attorney Farley will wait the required 30 days for an appeal before submitting a judgment for the remaining balance. Dangerous Tree Removal Blue Ridge Tree Service removed six hazardous trees from around the Administration Building on Friday, June 20. The cost of removing the trees was 2,000.00. The wood was left behind so that community members could collect it and use it for heating purposes. Guard Shack Heater Estimates for a new heating unit in the Guard Shack have been received from several HVAC companies: Laux Heat  Air at 3,000.00, Bottini Fuel at 3,050.00, SOS at 4,405.35, and Dibo  s HVAC at 3,000.00. Vegetation Management and Lake Management I received three quotes from Tigris Aquatic Services LLC for vegetation management. One is for a single herbicide application to eliminate vegetation growing in the rip - rap of Conashaugh Lake Dam, costing 1,007.00. The others are for treating 6 acres of submerged weeds, including Elodea, Bladderwort, and Sago Pondweed, for 2,862.00 and Seneca Lake for 2,141.20. Excessive growth can decrease dissolved oxygen levels during summer, leading to fish kills. Lake Closed for Swimming The Department of Health contacted the Administration Office on June 18, advising that we had to close and prohibit swimming due to a high E. coli level caused by all the rain we  ve received. The level has since decreased; however, we must have a single day passing sample below 235 and then go back 30 days from the collection date, enter the data on a geometric spreadsheet provided by the DOH. The total E. coli level must be below 126 for the lake to reopen for swimming. Fishing and boating are still permitted. Pre - bid Meeting  Compactor Project A pre - bid meeting was held on Monday, June 30 th, at 9:00 a.m. on - site for the compactor project. Kiley  Associates met with me, Craig Cuneo, as well as three contractors. Questions were raised regarding the power source for the compactors; a site survey is to be conducted by Kiley  Associates to determine the number of trees that will need to be removed from the area. The contractors bids will include the cost to cut and haul away the trees. Plans for a small building to monitor the area were also discussed. Kiley  Associates would like specifications for the self - contained dumpsters that will be placed at the new site. I contacted Eagle Equipment to see if they could provide me with the specs; I am waiting for Adam to get back to me to determine if a proposal for the same was ever submitted. Kiley  Associates will be emailing me with the questions and responses. On - site Unarmed Security Quotes A meeting was held with John Schaffer, Branch Manager at St. Moritz, in July to discuss the renewal of the contract with CLCA that expires in October. A 3 increase will take effect at the time of renewal, increasing the current hourly rate of 27.29 to 28.11 per hour. We also discussed pricing for a three - year contract with a 2 increase for the second and third year. KRE Security LLC also submitted a proposal for a one - year contract at a rate of 33.00 per hour. Both proposals include a marked security vehicle, fuel, and the holiday rate is billed at time and a half.",

This causes bears and other predatory animals to frequent the recyclable area, caus- ing destruction and a mess. Do not put food trash in the recycling containers  Someone left six bags of garbage outside the locked compactor gates on the morning of July 20, 2025 at 9:35 am. This could possibly cause predatory animals to frequent that area also so do not leave trash bags outside the compactor area.  Cardboard boxes must be flattened put in the recycling containers. They should NOT be put in the compactor. This is stated in our Rules and Regulations, Section 14.3 arti- cle j, which states as follows: All. flattened. cardboard,.magazines,.and.newspapers.are.to.be.placed.in.the. designated.CLCA.recycle.container.at.the.designated.site.during.posted.times. only.  Bags of leaves, lawn chairs, lockers and safes are not to be placed in the recycling bins. If these items are found in the bins by the waste company, we will be fined. The list of NON - RECYCLABLE items is as follows: Styrofoam Window Glass and Mirrors Electronic waste TVs and computers Motor oil containers Yard Waste leaves, etc Any Chemical containers Shredded Paper Plastic Bags Ceramics or Dishes Food Waste Any Scrap metal Lawn Chairs Folding Tables Exercise Equipment Safes Large Rubbermaid containers  This past month, there was a complaint of possible road rage made by one of our members. The vehicle in question was not registered in our systems. Keep in mind that in Pennsylvania, road rage is considered a criminal offense and can escalate quickly. If anyone is involved in such an incident, it is advisable to call PSP and re- port it. Try to get the license plate if you can as well.",

        "content": "20 SUMMER 2025 RATTLESNAKES Yes, rattlesnakes are found in Pennsylvania. The two venomous species native to the state are the Timber Rattlesnake and the Eastern Massasauga. The Eastern Copperhead is also venomous but not a rattlesnake. Timber Rattlesnakes are more common and found in 51 of Pennsylvanias 67 counties, according to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Rattlesnake Species in Pennsylvania: Timber Rattlesnake Crotalus horridus: This is the most commonly encountered rattlesnake in Pennsylvania. They are known for their stout bodies and variable color patterns, which can be brown or black bands on a yellow to black background, according to the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program. Eastern Massasauga Sistrurus catenatus catenatus: This species prefers wet meadows and prairie areas, which are found in specific western counties of Pennsylvania. Safety Measures If you encounter a rattlesnake, remain calm, avoid sudden movements, and maintain a safe distance at least 10 feet. Do not attempt to kill or handle the snake, and do not throw objects at it. Alert others to the snakes presence and keep children and pets away. If bitten, seek immediate medical attention. Safety Tips Stay Calm: Panicking can lead to sudden movements that may startle or provoke the snake. Maintain Distance: Rattlesnakes typically strike when they feel threatened, so keeping a safe distance at least 10 feet is crucial. Dont Provoke: Avoid throwing objects, attempting to move the snake, or otherwise disturbing it. Alert Others: Let other people in the area know about the snakes location and advise them to proceed with caution. Keep Pets and Children Away: Ensure children and pets are kept at a safe distance from the snake. Seek Medical Attention: If bitten, seek immediate medical attention. If you hear a rattle: Stop and locate the sound before reacting. If you can safely back away, do so. On Trails: Stay on designated trails, avoid tall grass, and be aware of your surroundings. Keep your dog on a leash. If it doesnt move: If the snake doesnt move off the trail, its often best to wait it out or turn back.",

        "content": "22 SUMMER 2025 What could be the downside of criticizing my HOA  s Board of Directors? Criticizing your community and its Board of Directors on Facebook can have significant downsides, both for individuals and the broader community. Social media posts are often permanent and highly visible, making it easy for offhand or poorly worded criticisms to cause lasting reputational harm that could impact home prices. It could impact how contractors view doing business with the community. It could impact the relationship that the community has with its banker and insurance provider. For example, let  s imagine that someone in the community posted a negative comment about the management of a CLCA project and for some reason the project ended up in a legal dispute. That criticism may become evidence that the insurance company uses as justification to raise the premium for the community. Who suffers - the homeowners that pay as a part of their dues the Insurance premium. So, think before you post. Also, unlike face - to - face conversations, online comments lack the immediate feedback of body language and tone, which can lead to misunderstandings, misquotes, and sweeping generalizations that distort the truth and escalate tensions. This dynamic can result in ruined reputations, damaged relationships, and can lead to legal proceedings, if the posts become harassment or slanderous. It actually strikes me as a bit cowardly to use the anonymity and distance provided by social platforms to embolden oneself to be aggressive and unkind. Criticism of our community and its board of directors on Facebook can undermine trust in the community leadership, erode the community fabric, and sow disunity among residents. Social media debates can quickly devolve into factionalism, with personal attacks and misinformation fueling open conflict rather than constructive dialogue. This not only distracts board members from their responsibilities but also makes it harder to resolve issues effectively. Furthermore, viral posts can attract attention beyond the community, exposing sensitive matters to outsiders and increasing the risk of reduced reputation and influence for both individuals and our community as a whole. Ultimately, while transparency and accountability are important, airing grievances on Facebook often does more harm than good. We need our board of directors, our volunteers, and the members of our community especially those with leadership training to help put a stop to the offensive Facebook posts. We will all benefit ethically and financially. A more constructive alternative to Facebook would be to volunteer to join and bring your perspective to committees, routinely attend committee and board meetings, and civilly engage with members of the board. If you are already a volunteer, please consider what you post and its impact before you post it! John A. Thies Rules  Regulations Liaison",

        "content": "23 SUMMER 2025 The Benefits of Volunteering: Why You Should Get Involved in Your Community Volunteering is one of the most rewarding activities you can engage in, both for yourself and for your community. Whether you  re lending a helping hand at the annual picnic, participating in a community cleanup, or helping the kids do an art project, the benefits of volunteering are abundant. Here are some compelling reasons to consider getting involved: 1. Make a Positive Impact One of the most significant benefits of volunteering is the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others. Your time and effort can help improve your community, support those in need, and create a more inclusive environment. Knowing that your actions contribute to a greater cause can be incredibly fulfilling. 2. Build Connections Volunteering allows you to meet new people who share your interests and values. You  ll have the chance to connect with fellow volunteers, community members, and even those you  re helping. These relationships can lead to lasting friendships, a stronger support network, and a greater sense of belonging in your community. 3. Learn New Skills When you volunteer, you often have the opportunity to learn and develop new skills. Whether it  s project management, communication, or even specific skills like gardening or teaching, volunteering can enhance your resume and prepare you for future opportunities. Plus, it  s a great way to explore new interests! 4. Boost Your Mental Health Numerous studies have shown that volunteering can improve mental health. Helping others can reduce stress, combat depression, and increase feelings of happiness and satisfaction. The sense of purpose that comes from giving back can lead to greater overall well - being. 5. Gain a New Perspective Volunteering exposes you to different experiences and viewpoints that you might not encounter in your daily life. This can lead to greater empathy and understanding, helping you appreciate the diversity within your community. It can also inspire you to take action in other areas of your life. 6. Enhance Your Community When you volunteer, you contribute to the betterment of your community. Your efforts can lead to cleaner parks, more accessible resources for those in need, and programs that support education, health, and well - being. Together, volunteers can create a stronger, more vibrant community for everyone. Create Lasting Memories The experiences you gain through volunteering can be some of the most memorable moments of your life. From organizing events to participating in community activities, you  ll create stories and memories that you can cherish for years to come. Get Involved Today! With so many benefits to gain, it  s time to take the plunge and get involved in your community. Look for committees or events that resonate with you, and don  t hesitate to reach out. Whether you have a few hours or a long - term commitment to offer, your contribution can make a significant difference. Volunteering is not just about helping others; it  s about enriching your own life in the process. So why wait? Join the movement of community volunteers and experience the joy and fulfillment that comes from giving back!",

Win - win. Ingredients: 12 cup blueberries 12 cup strawberries hulled and chopped 1 cup plain Greek yogurt Directions: Blend berries and yogurt until beautifully purple and creamy. Pour the mixture into ice molds  in whatever ridiculous shapes you want. Freeze for at least 4 hours. Confession: These are actually pretty tasty for humans, too but don  t tell your dog. Frozen Banana Cat Treats Ripe bananas Cat treats Catmilk  such as Whiskas Catmilk Peel and Slice the Bananas: Start by peeling the ripe ba- nanas and cutting them into small, bite - sized pieces. This makes it easier to blend later. Blend the Bananas: Place the banana slices into a blend- er or food processor and add the Catmilk. Blend until you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. You will make at a ratio of one banana to one Catmilk container. Place Cat Treats in Ice Cube Tray: You will put the cat treats in the bottom of the tray.

        "content": "28 SUMMER 2025 Ingredients You  ll Need  1 plastic lid such as from a yogurt or sour cream container  Clear school glue enough to cover the bottom of your lid  A few drops of food coloring various colors  1 toothpick for swirling the colors  1 hole punch to make a hole for hanging  1 piece of ribbon, string, or fishing line for hanging Step - by - Step Instructions 1. Begin by choosing a plastic lid that will act as the base for your suncatcher. Clean it thoroughly and dry it completely. 2. Next, pour clear school glue into the lid until it covers the entire bottom. Gently tilt the lid if needed to spread the glue evenly. 3. Afterward, carefully add several drops of food coloring into the glue. You can opt for one color or multiple to create a rainbow - like effect. 4. Then, take your toothpick and gently swirl the food coloring through the glue. Be careful not to overmix, so the colors remain distinct and don  t muddy. 5. Now, set the lid aside in a safe, level place to dry. Depending on the glue  s thickness and humidity levels, drying could take anywhere from 8 to 24 hours. 6. Once fully dry and firm, remove the suncatcher from the lid. It should peel away easily. If it sticks, gently flex the lid to loosen it. 7. Use a hole punch to make a hole near the top of your suncatcher. 8. Finally, thread your ribbon or string through the hole, tie a knot, and hang your suncatcher in a sunny window to admire the vibrant colors shining through! Let  s have some fun making glue suncatchers",

        "content": "40 SUMMER 2025 HOME SECURITY Here is a list of suggestions of what we can do to keep our family, home and property safe. 1. Secure Doors and Windows  Use solid core or metal doors for all entry points.  Install deadbolt locks on exterior doors.  Reinforce sliding glass doors with a security bar or pin.  Ensure all windows have secure locks and consider window bars or security film. 2. Install a Security System  Invest in a home security system with alarms, cam- eras, and motion detectors.  Display security system signage to deter potential intruders. 3. Use Outdoor Lighting  Install motion - activated lights around entry points and dark areas of your property.  Keep outdoor lights on during the night to increase visibility. 4. Create the Illusion of Occupancy  Use timers to turn on lights, radios, or TVs when you  re not home.  Have a trusted neighbor collect your mail and pack- ages while you  re away. 5. Maintain Your Yard  Keep bushes and trees trimmed to eliminate hid- ing spots for intruders.  Use gravel or pebbles as ground cover near win- dows and doors to make noise when walked on. 6. Secure Your Garage  Keep garage doors closed and locked.  Install a security camera or motion sensor light in the garage. 7. Use Smart Technology  Consider smart locks and doorbell cameras to moni- tor entry points.  Use smart home systems that allow you to control lights and alarms remotely. 8. Be Cautious with Social Media  Avoid posting about your travel plans or being away from home on social media.  Wait until you  re back home to share vacation pho- tos. 9. Install a Peephole or Video Doorbell  Use a peephole or video doorbell to see who is at your door before opening it. 10. Keep Valuables Out of Sight  Store valuables, including electronics, jewelry, and important documents, in a safe or in hidden loca- tions.  Avoid leaving expensive items in plain view, espe- cially near windows. 11. Know Your Neighbors  Look out for each other  s homes and report any suspicious activity 12. Reinforce Windows  Consider installing window locks or security screens.  Use shatter - resistant glass or window film to make it harder to break in. By implementing these safety tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of a break - in and help protect your home and belongings.
