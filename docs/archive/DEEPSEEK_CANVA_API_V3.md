Of course. This is an excellent evolution of the project. Integrating the full power of the Canva Connect APIs, especially **Brand Templates** and **Data Autofill**, fundamentally transforms the application from a simple content manager into a dynamic, automated design and publication engine.

Here are the updated prompts, refined to leverage these powerful APIs, incorporate print into the core workflow, and enhance the contributor experience with clear, actionable notifications.

### **Revised Phase 4: Advanced Automation & Streamlined Workflows**

**Prompt 7: Brand Template & Autofill API Integration (The Core Automation)**
"Implement the core automation feature using the Brand Template and Autofill APIs to revolutionize the submission process .

1.  **Template Registry:** Create a new Firestore collection `canvaTemplates`. Store template IDs (from Canva) mapped to your internal `ContentType` (e.g., `event_flyer`, `volunteer_spotlight`). Configure each template with a JSON schema defining its autofillable fields (e.g., `eventTitle`, `eventDate`, `volunteerName`).

2.  **Dynamic Design Creation:** Modify the `SubmitContentPage.vue` submission logic. Upon form submission, the application should:
    *   Identify the correct Canva Brand Template ID based on the content type.
    *   Use the **Autofill API** to automatically create a design, populating it with the data from the form . The app should structure the form data to match the predefined schema for that template.
    *   Immediately attach the resulting design to the `ContentSubmissionData` object, setting its status to `pending_review`. This creates a nearly-instant, professionally designed first draft.

3.  **User Experience:** The UI should clearly indicate that a design was 'Auto-created & awaiting review'. This removes the initial design barrier for contributors, making the first step incredibly easy and fun."

**Prompt 8: Integrated Print Preparation Workflow**
"Formalize the print workflow by integrating the **Export API** directly into the approval process .

1.  **Print-Ready Export Trigger:** Extend the existing admin approval logic in `ContentManagementPage.vue`. When an admin changes a status to `approved`, the application should automatically call the `CanvaApiService.exportDesign()` method to generate a high-resolution, print-ready PDF.

2.  **Print Job Management:** Upon successful export, the system should automatically create a document in the `printJobs` collection. This document should:
    *   Link to the `content` document and its exported PDF URL.
    *   Have a status of `print_ready`.
    *   Specify the `quantity` needed (could be a default or set by the admin).
    *   Be visible on a new `/print-queue` page.

3.  **Community Action:** On the `/print-queue` page, volunteers can:
    *   **Claim** a print job, changing its status to `claimed` and committing to printing the specified quantity.
    *   **Mark as Done** once printed and distributed.
    This turns a logistical bottleneck into a transparent, gamified task that the community can solve together."

### **New Phase 5: Notification & Engagement System**

**Prompt 9: Real-Time Activity Feed & Notifications**
"Implement a system-wide activity feed to increase engagement and transparency using Webhooks and the Comments API .

1.  **Activity Feed Component:** Create a new `ActivityFeed.vue` component that displays a real-time list of events from the `activityLog` Firestore collection.
2.  **Automated Logging:** Create Cloud Functions that automatically log key events to the `activityLog`:
    *   `content_submitted`: 'A new event, "Fall Festival," has been submitted and is awaiting review!'
    *   `design_exported`: 'The flyer for "Fall Festival" is print-ready! üñ®Ô∏è Can anyone print 50 copies?'
    *   `print_job_claimed`: 'Sarah volunteered to print the "Fall Festival" flyers!'
    *   `comment_added`: 'Michael left feedback on the "Volunteer Dinner" design.'
3.  **User Notification:** Use Quasar's `$q.notify()` to send users brief, actionable desktop notifications for events relevant to them (e.g., an editor gets a notification for `content_submitted`).

**Prompt 10: Enhanced Comment System with Canva Sync**
"Upgrade the comment system to bi-directionally sync with Canva using the **Comments API**, moving beyond simple Google Drive links .

1.  **Bidirectional Sync:** When a user adds a comment on your platform, use the Comments API to post it to the corresponding design in Canva. Conversely, set up a webhook listener for Canva's comment events to sync them back to your Firestore `comments` subcollection.
2.  **Contextual Actions:** In the comment UI, alongside text, provide buttons for common actions:
    *   **`Add to Print Queue`**: Allows a user to instantly create a `print_ready` job from the commented-on design.
    *   **`Request Changes`**: This button pre-fills a comment with "Changes requested!" and pings the original contributor via a notification.
3.  **Mentions:** Implement a `@mention` system that sends a specific notification to the mentioned user, pulling them back into the conversation."

### **New Phase 6: Polished Contributor Experience**

**Prompt 11: Gamified Onboarding & Guides**
"Create an engaging, gamified onboarding flow to encourage contribution.

1.  **Interactive Guide:** Transform the `GuideModal.vue` into an interactive walkthrough using a library like `driver.js`. Guide new users through the steps: submitting a event, seeing the auto-generated design, and checking the print queue.
2.  **Achievement System:** Create a simple system that awards badges (displayed on the user's profile) for milestones like `First Submission`, `Five Flyers Printed`, `Helpful Commenter`.
3.  **Progress Indicators:** On the main dashboard, show users clear progress indicators for their tasks and the overall newsletter (e.g., 'We need 3 more articles to complete this month's issue!')."

**Prompt 12: Comprehensive Error Handling & User Feedback**
"Implement robust, user-friendly error handling specific to the Canva Connect APIs .

1.  **Error Mapping:** In your `CanvaApiService`, create a mapping of Canva error codes (e.g., `design_not_found`, `too_many_requests`) to translated, friendly user messages .
2.  **Graceful Degradation:** For critical features that depend on preview APIs (like Autofill), build a fallback. If the Autofill API call fails, the app should gracefully degrade to the previous behavior of creating an empty design from the template, rather than breaking entirely.
3.  **User Feedback Loop:** Add a 'Report a Problem' button near any error notification, allowing users to instantly submit feedback that is logged with the technical error details for you to debug."

This refined approach leverages the Canva ecosystem to its maximum potential, automating the mundane, gamifying participation, and creating a clear, transparent workflow that makes contributors feel empowered and valued, ultimately leading to a more vibrant and sustainable community newsletter.
