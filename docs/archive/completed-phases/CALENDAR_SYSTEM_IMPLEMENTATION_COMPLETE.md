## 🔧 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### **CalendarEvent Interface**
```typescript
export interface CalendarEvent {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  authorName: string;
  authorEmail?: string;
  tags: string[];
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived';

  // Date feature data
  eventDate: string; // ISO 8601 date string
  eventEndDate?: string;
  eventTime?: string;
  eventEndTime?: string;
  allDay: boolean;

  // Location feature data (if present)
  eventLocation?: string;

  // Additional features
  featured: boolean;
  eventRecurrence?: {
    type: 'none' | 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly';
    interval?: number;
    endDate?: string;
    daysOfWeek?: number[];
    dayOfMonth?: number;
  };
}
```

### **Calendar Composable Architecture**
```typescript
export const useCalendarContent = () => {
  const events = ref<CalendarEvent[]>([]);
  const isLoading = ref(false);
  const error = ref<string | null>(null);

  const calendarState = ref<CalendarState>({
    currentMonth: getCurrentMonth(),
    currentYear: getCurrentYear(),
    selectedDate: null,
    viewMode: 'month',
  });

  // Comprehensive calendar functionality including:
  // - Event loading and filtering
  // - Calendar navigation
  // - Real-time updates
  // - Event management operations
};
```
