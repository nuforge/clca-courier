2. **Design Creation Flow**
   - User clicks "Create with Canva" button
   - System checks Canva OAuth authentication status
   - If not authenticated: redirects to Canva OAuth flow
   - If authenticated: creates design from template using Canva API

3. **Design Management**
   - Success: Design status chip appears with "Edit in Canva" link
   - User can open design in new tab for editing
   - Design status updates reflect current state (draft/pending/exported)

4. **Content Submission**
   - User submits content as normal through existing workflow
   - System automatically attaches Canva design to submitted content
   - Success notification includes both content submission and design attachment

5. **Export & Download** (Future Phase)
   - When design is exported, "Download Design" button becomes available
   - User can export high-quality design files for print production
