## üèóÔ∏è Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Statistics Grid Component Design

**Decision**: Create a generic statistics display component that works with any metric data.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface StatItem {
  label: string;
  value: string | number;
  icon: string;
  color: string;
  description?: string;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Reusable**: Can display any set of statistics across admin pages
- **Responsive**: Configurable column layouts (1-6 columns)
- **Interactive**: Clickable stats with event emission for detailed views
- **Loading States**: Built-in skeleton loading for improved UX

### 2. Action Toolbar Component Design

**Decision**: Create a component that handles action sections rather than simple button toolbars.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ActionSection {
  title: string;
  titleIcon: string;
  description: string;
  primaryAction: ActionButton;
  secondaryActions: ActionButton[];
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Flexible**: Handles complex action workflows with primary and secondary actions
- **Generic**: Works with navigation, dialogs, and function calls
- **Permission-Ready**: Structured for future permission-based action visibility
- **Consistent**: Maintains admin interface consistency across pages

### 3. Data Transformation Strategy

**Decision**: Use computed properties to transform existing data into base component formats.

**Implementation**:
- **adminStats computed**: Transforms stats object into StatItem[]
- **actionSections computed**: Transforms action patterns into ActionSection[]
- **Event handlers**: Bridge component events to existing functionality

**Benefits**:
- **Clean Separation**: Base components remain generic
- **Data Integrity**: Original data sources preserved
- **Future-Ready**: Easy to modify data transformations
