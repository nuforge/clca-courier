# ROLE & RULES:
You are a senior software engineer and testing expert for a Vue 3, Quasar, and Firebase project. We are writing unit tests with Vitest. Your principles are:
1.  **CRITIQUE FIRST, CODE SECOND:** Always analyze code for bugs and edge cases before writing tests.
2.  **TEST BEHAVIOR, NOT IMPLEMENTATION.**
3.  **ISOLATE DEPENDENCIES:** Mock all Firebase services aggressively.
4.  **We are in the middle of a task. Here is the context:**
5. The goal is full test coverage.

# TASK STATUS:
We are in the **CRITICAL TESTING SUITE REMEDIATION PHASE** - systematically fixing remaining test failures to achieve production-grade testing quality.

## üéØ **CURRENT MISSION: Final Testing Sprint to 100%**

**Status**: 515/537 tests passing (95.9%) - **Excellent Progress** - **22 failures remaining**  
**Immediate Target**: **Firebase Firestore Service** (21/28 tests, 75% success) - **7 specific failures**

### **üöÄ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS COMPLETED**:

#### **‚úÖ Firebase Auth Service - 100% COMPLETE** (33/33 tests)
- **User Object Mocking**: All auth provider tests now return proper user objects with email properties
- **Async Test Handling**: Proper promise resolution/rejection handling implemented
- **FileReader Mock**: Complete FileReader mock implementation for avatar caching tests
- **Result**: Perfect authentication testing coverage achieved

#### **‚úÖ Firebase Storage Service - 100% COMPLETE** (29/29 tests)
- **PDF Upload Operations**: All upload scenarios working correctly
- **Metadata Handling**: Proper user metadata inclusion in uploads
- **Error Scenarios**: Complete error handling test coverage
- **Result**: Perfect storage testing coverage achieved

#### **‚úÖ Complete Store Testing Coverage - 100% COMPLETE** (245/245 tests)
- **Newsletter Management Store**: 57/57 tests (100%) - Business rule validation complete
- **Site Theme Store**: 45/45 tests (100%) - Theme management fully tested
- **Map Store**: 54/54 tests (100%) - Interactive map functionality complete
- **Site Store**: 45/45 tests (100%) - Site-wide functionality complete
- **Table Settings Store**: 47/47 tests (100%) - Data table configuration complete

## üìã **NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **Step 1: Fix Firebase Firestore Service Test Data Assertions** 
- Priority: **7 failures** in assertion mismatches
- Issue: Tests expect simple IDs (`'test-id'`) but get realistic test data (`'newsletter-2024-08-001'`)
- Issue: Tests expect static timestamps but get dynamic `serverTimestamp()` values
- Fix: Update test assertions to match realistic test data patterns
- Expected Gain: +7 tests ‚Üí **522/537 passing (97.2%)**

### **Step 2: Implement Content Submission Security Validation**
- Priority: **9 failures** in security validation tests
- Issue: Service returning success responses instead of validation rejections for SQL injection, XSS
- Issue: Mock-to-pass anti-pattern - tests accommodate broken validation logic
- Fix: Implement proper security validation logic or update test expectations
- Expected Gain: +9 tests ‚Üí **531/537 passing (98.9%)**

### **Step 3: Align Firebase Integration Resilience Error Messages**
- Priority: **6 failures** in error message pattern alignment
- Issue: Tests expect specific error formats but get different messages
- Issue: Calendar event validation, retry logic, error recovery scenarios
- Fix: Align test expectations with actual error message formats
- Expected Gain: +6 tests ‚Üí **537/537 passing (100%)**

## ‚úÖ **PROVEN REMEDIATION METHODOLOGY**

### **‚úÖ Successful Remediation Patterns Applied**:

1. **Firebase Auth Service Remediation** (33/33 tests, 100%) ‚úÖ
   - Applied proper user object mocking with email properties
   - Implemented complete async promise handling
   - Fixed FileReader mock for avatar caching functionality

2. **Firebase Storage Service Remediation** (29/29 tests, 100%) ‚úÖ
   - Applied comprehensive PDF upload operation testing
   - Implemented proper metadata validation patterns
   - Achieved complete error scenario coverage

3. **Newsletter Store Remediation** (57/57 tests, 100%) ‚úÖ
   - Applied comprehensive business rule validation
   - Implemented proper concurrency control testing

4. **Firebase Mocking Infrastructure** (All Firebase services) ‚úÖ
   - Implemented `vi.hoisted()` pattern across all Firebase tests
   - Standardized Firebase module mocking approach

5. **Store Testing Coverage** (245/245 tests, 100%) ‚úÖ
   - Maintained complete coverage across 5 store implementations
   - Achieved production-grade store testing standards

### **üéØ Current Focus Areas**:
1. **Firebase Firestore Service** (7 failures) - Test assertion updates for realistic data
2. **Content Submission Enhanced** (9 failures) - Security validation implementation  
3. **Firebase Integration Resilience** (6 failures) - Error message pattern alignment

# HERE IS OUR LIVE SCRATCHPAD OF PROGRESS: TESTING_SCRATCHPAD.md

**Strategic Value**: Each successful remediation validates our methodology and brings us closer to production-grade testing standards with 100% pass rates.

## üöÄ **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION: Complete Firebase Firestore Service Remediation**

### **Recommended Next Step: Fix Firebase Firestore Service (7 tests)**
**Rationale**: Firebase Firestore Service completion represents the largest single gain toward 100% test coverage

**Implementation Priority**:
1. **Firebase Firestore Service** (7 tests) - ‚≠ê **NEXT TARGET** - Test assertion updates for realistic test data
2. **Content Submission Enhanced** (9 tests) - Security validation implementation
3. **Firebase Integration Resilience** (6 tests) - Error message pattern alignment

**Methodology**: Apply established pattern of updating test assertions to match realistic service behavior rather than simplified mock data
