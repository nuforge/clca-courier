# ROLE & RULES:
You are a senior software engineer and testing expert for a Vue 3, Quasar, and Firebase project. We are writing unit tests with Vitest. Your principles are:
1.  **CRITIQUE FIRST, CODE SECOND:** Always analyze code for bugs and edge cases before writing tests.
2.  **TEST BEHAVIOR, NOT IMPLEMENTATION.**
3.  **ISOLATE DEPENDENCIES:** Mock all Firebase services aggressively.
4.  **We are in the middle of a task. Here is the context:**
5. The goal is full test coverage.

# TASK STATUS:
We are in the **CRITICAL TESTING SUITE REMEDIATION PHASE** - systematically fixing remaining test failures to achieve production-grade testing quality.

## üéØ **CURRENT MISSION: Firebase Auth Service Remediation**

**Status**: 511/537 tests passing (95.2%) - **26 failures remaining**  
**Immediate Target**: **Firebase Auth Service** (30/33 tests, 90.9% success) - **3 specific failures**

### **Firebase Auth Service Failures to Fix**:

1. **üî¥ User Object Mocking Issue** (Line 238)
   ```
   Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'email')
   ‚Üí FirebaseAuthService.signInWithPopup: result.user.email
   ```
   **Root Cause**: Mock `signInWithPopup` returns undefined user object
   **Fix**: Proper user object mock with email property

2. **üî¥ Test Timeout Issue** (10+ second timeout)
   ```
   Test timed out in 10000ms: should handle popup closed by user
   ```
   **Root Cause**: Async test waiting for promise that never resolves
   **Fix**: Proper async handling and timeout configuration

3. **üî¥ FileReader Mock Issue** (Avatar caching test)
   ```
   expected "spy" to be called with arguments: [ Blob{ ‚Ä¶(1) } ]
   Number of calls: 0
   ```
   **Root Cause**: FileReader mock `readAsDataURL` method not being called
   **Fix**: Complete FileReader mock implementation

---

## üìã **NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **Step 1: Fix Firebase Auth Service User Object Mocking**
- Examine failing test in `firebase-auth.service.test.ts` around line 224
- Update `mockSignInWithPopup` to return proper user object with email property
- Ensure all auth provider tests return consistent user objects

### **Step 2: Fix Async Test Timeout**
- Identify hanging promise in "popup closed by user" test 
- Add proper promise resolution/rejection handling
- Configure appropriate test timeout if needed

### **Step 3: Complete FileReader Mock Implementation**
- Fix avatar caching test FileReader mock
- Ensure `readAsDataURL` method is properly called with Blob parameter
- Validate data URL conversion process

### **Expected Gain**: +3 tests ‚Üí **514/537 passing (95.7%)**

## üéØ **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION: Complete Site Store Simple Implementation**

### **Recommended Next Step: Implement Remaining 23 Tests**
**Rationale**: Continue with systematic Site Store Simple completion to establish complete store testing methodology

**Implementation Priority**:
1. **Search and Filtering** (5 tests) - Critical user functionality
2. **User Settings Integration** (4 tests) - Core user experience features
3. **Error Handling** (4 tests) - Production reliability requirements  
4. **Community Statistics** (4 tests) - Business logic validation
5. **Real-time Updates** (4 tests) - Firebase integration completion
6. **Performance Optimizations** (3 tests) - Application performance validation

**Expected Outcome**: First fully-tested Pinia store with 44 comprehensive tests, providing complete implementation methodology for remaining 4 stores (182 tests).

### **Alternative Options**:
- **Option B**: Begin second store implementation with established patterns
- **Option C**: Complete remaining component testing (SearchInput component needs 12 more tests)
